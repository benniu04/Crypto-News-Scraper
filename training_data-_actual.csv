,BlackRock leads Bitcoin ETFs with record inflows,"BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) exchange-traded fund (ETF) had US$788 million in inflows on March 5 and set a new daily record by buying 12,000 more Bitcoins.
The addition appears to have followed Bitcoin’s steep drop after it set a new all-time price record.

BlackRock and Fidelity dominate the spot Bitcoin ETF space, with combined assets under management (AUM) of over US$19 billion, The Block reported, citing data from BitMEX.
Bitcoin investment products around the world now manage over one million Bitcoins or approximately 5% of the asset’s circulating supply.
The majority of these assets are held by U.S. spot and futures Bitcoin ETFs, with Europe and Canada being the second and third largest markets, respectively, according to The Block.
This influx of investments into Bitcoin ETFs, particularly in the U.S., indicates a shift in the cryptocurrency’s role in price discovery and reflects its growing acceptance among traditional investors.
Bitcoin traded above US$67,000 at 1 p.m. ET, rebounding from yesterday’s drop to around US$60,000, according to CoinGecko data.","BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) exchange-traded fund (ETF) had US$788 million in inflows on March 5 and set a new daily record by buying 12,000 more Bitcoins.

,"Behind Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin's Wild Ride","It's been a crazy 24 hours for some of the biggest cryptocurrencies in the world. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) peaked at $68,800 in early trading on Tuesday, only to crash to 61,400 five hours later. As I'm writing at 11 a.m. Wednesday, its price is hovering around $66,500 and seems to have stabilized.
Unsurprisingly, Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) followed a similar path, peaking at $3,805 in early trading Tuesday, falling to $3,360, and now trading at $3,800 again. Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) slid from $0.188 down to $0.132, but is now back up to $0.162.
Bitcoin's flash crash
The rapid drop in Bitcoin on Tuesday was driven by some profit-taking by traders, which was natural after its big run-up. CoinDesk also reported that Bitcoin miners were also seen selling some tokens to lock in profits in their business.
Many Bitcoin miners keep the crypto on their balance sheets for extended periods, which gives them leveraged exposure. But that's only valuable if they eventually take profits.
The blockchain itself exposes some of the inner workings of the crypto market. Tracking movements on the blockchain can tell when certain actors are moving Bitcoin to exchanges or making decentralized sales. And that information can be shared extremely quickly.
The ETF craze continues
Funds flowing into Bitcoin ETFs continue to keep the market afloat -- the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin ETF (NASDAQ: IBIT) pulled in $778 million on Tuesday alone. That fund now holds 183,000 Bitcoin and is one of the biggest owners of the token in the world.
As money continues flowing into ETFs, the buying pressure pushes Bitcoin's price higher, and because it is the leading crypto, other tokens follow in its wake.
But that may be the most bullish news for Ethereum and Dogecoin. It has now been proven that there's investor interest in owning cryptocurrencies through ETFs, and Ethereum and Dogecoin will likely be the next ones to get ETFs approved. They have two of the biggest market caps in the crypto industry and are widely held by investors.
What's holding the industry back is that such funds require regulatory approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has been reluctant to give it. But there are several court cases ongoing that could provide clarity on what is and isn't a security. Decisions in those cases could lead to approval for more crypto ETFs.
Caution is needed in crypto
The recent rise in cryptocurrency prices has been driven almost entirely by speculation and inflows of funds into coins and ETFs over the last few months. Both trends can reverse just as quickly as they arose, so investors need to be cautious.

For example, in 2021, values surged, only to come crashing down to earth in 2022. The prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin have moved with a significant level of correlation to growth stocks -- and valuations of those equities are getting stretched to a point that their rise may not be sustainable.
This crypto bull run may continue, but investors should be prepared for a pullback.  If history is any guide, one is likely coming","It's been a crazy 24 hours for some of the biggest cryptocurrencies in the world.

,Bitcoin Reaches Another All-Time High. What Next?,"Bitcoin continued its rally yesterday, breaking through the $69,000 barrier and setting a new all-time high. The leading cryptocurrency has gained almost 60% since the start of the year, per CoinMarketCap data. Its rise has been fueled by the SEC's approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF and the upcoming Bitcoin halving.
Bitcoin's last high came during the crypto frenzy in November 2021. That was before the industry was shaken by a series of calamities, including the failure of Terraform's Luna, the collapse of FTX, and subsequent revelations about what both companies were doing with investor money.
If you got burned by previous crypto price crashes, or are nervous about buying Bitcoin, you may well be wondering if this rally is different and if Bitcoin might hold its gains. The short answer is that only time will tell.
What next for Bitcoin?
Crypto investors are likely used to the volatility of the crypto market. Unlike the stock market, it isn't unusual to see huge price swings in a matter of days. Indeed, Bitcoin dropped around 10% immediately after hitting its new high before climbing slightly and finishing the day around $67,000.
Crypto enthusiasts such as Galaxy Digital's Mike Novogratz say that this is just the start. But given that Novogratz was so excited about Terraform's Luna, he got a Luna tattoo before the whole enterprise caved in, it's hard to take his optimism seriously.
That said, Novogratz is not alone. A lot of insiders are confident this rally is different. That's partly because the spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted more institutional money, which tends to be stickier. Plus, there's growing optimism that the Fed will soon start cutting rates and the U.S. might skirt a recession.
Bear in mind that neither the improved economic outlook nor the influx of institutional money say anything about Bitcoin's fundamentals. That's what matters, particularly if you are a long-term investor.
Cryptocurrency is still a risky asset
I hold Bitcoin (along with other cryptocurrencies) and am certainly relieved to see prices recover. Even so, price doesn't reflect value. It can be arbitrary and move based on speculation and market sentiment. To put it another way, the fact that Bitcoin just erased the losses of recent years doesn't automatically make it a safe investment.
If you're considering buying Bitcoin, think about the fundamentals. Some Bitcoin believers think that cryptocurrency could become the digital currency of the internet. Others argue it is like digital gold, a store of value that cannot be controlled by governments. Others think it could take a portion of the international remittance market, as it makes it easy for people to move money internationally.
Bitcoin's critics say it doesn't have any intrinsic value. Despite all the hype, people are not using it as a currency -- in part because of the huge price fluctuations. Some argue that Bitcoin is mostly used for illicit activities, such as money laundering and ransomware. Plus, Bitcoin mining consumes vast amounts of energy, with a carbon footprint the size of a small country.
Four questions every crypto investor needs to consider
Whether you buy into one of the new spot Bitcoin ETFs or open an account with a cryptocurrency exchange, crypto investing is not for everyone. As with any investment, you need to take time to research and learn about what you're buying. Here are a few things to ask.
1. Do you understand the risk?
We've already touched on some of the risks involved in crypto, such as volatility and questions about its long-term potential. Another is that there are limited investor protections. Unlike money in a bank account which is covered by FDIC insurance against bank failure, if your crypto platform fails, you could lose everything.

One way you can mitigate this is to put your crypto into a crypto wallet that you control. Just be aware that if you lose your security information, you might lock yourself out of your wallet forever.
2. How will you cope if you lose your crypto investments?
Losing money is always difficult. But it is more manageable if you only invest money you can afford to lose. Some people lost their life savings when Terra's Luna cryptocurrency collapsed.
If you want to buy crypto, make sure it is only a small part of a wider portfolio. That way, if the crypto market does crash again, it won't derail your retirement plans or leave you unable to pay your rent or mortgage.
3. Are you comfortable with the regulatory environment?
Cryptocurrency is a relatively new and unregulated market. The SEC is pursuing cases against several top crypto exchanges because it believes many cryptocurrencies are trading as unregulated securities. The outcome of these cases -- alongside broader moves to introduce stricter crypto regulation -- could change the way people buy and sell crypto in the U.S.
4. Why are you buying cryptocurrency?
Many people bought cryptocurrency in 2021 because they were scared of missing out, only to get burned when prices crashed. Don't buy Bitcoin because other people are or because you think you might get rich quickly. History has already shown us that crypto prices can rise and drop dramatically.
Consider how your crypto investments fit with your wider investment goals and be clear on your rationale for buying. Clarity on the ""why"" can often be what stops us from panic selling if prices start to fall.
Bottom line
Bitcoin has erased the losses of the past few years and many insiders are confident the price can rise further.

,Robert Kiyosaki: Not Buying Bitcoin Is 'The Biggest Mistake You Can Make',"Robert Kiyosaki is a legend in the financial industry for his book ""Rich Dad Poor Dad."" The book has shown many the path to financial independence and cemented Kiyosaki as someone worth listening to, selling more than 40 million copies across 100 countries.
When Kiyosaki wrote the book in 2002, Bitcoin was not invented. However, his opinion on the token is valued, and many watch his social media accounts for advice and predictions.
His social media following got just that in a March 6 post on X. In the post, Kiyosaki says, ""BITCOIN on fire. The biggest mistake you can make is to procrastinate. Important to start, even if only for $500. Next stop $300,000 per BC in 2024.""
The post comes one day after Bitcoin reached a new ATH of just over $69,000. However, new highs do not scare Kiyosaki at all. The outspoken Bitcoin bull sees this run as only the beginning for Bitcoin in 2024.
YTD, Bitcoin is up more than 56% and is up 155% in the past 6 months. Despite this, Kiyosaki sees room for another increase of more than 300% before the end of the year. At that price, the market cap of Bitcoin would be approximately $5.5 trillion, more than that of Apple and NVIDIA combined.
It may seem a bit outlandish when you put it that way, but some see a legitimate path to those levels. If the inflation continues to taper and the Federal Reserve begins cutting rates, combined with the upcoming halving and continued inflows into ETFs, buying activity could be sustained throughout the remainder of 2024. However, this trajectory would require lots of moving parts to fall into place. Though unlikely, a $300,000 Bitcoin is not out of the question in 2024.
Looking back at past Bitcoin cycles, most have followed a similar pattern of barely reaching new all-time highs (ATHs) before falling back slightly and then reaching new highs around a year later. If Bitcoin were to follow this pattern again, investors could see a slight pullback in the near term before Bitcoin creates new highs in the next several months.
Additionally, Kiyosaki makes a good point about the practicality of Bitcoin investing. You can invest any amount of money into Bitcoin, ranging from a few dollars to billions. This factor allows anyone with extra cash to buy Bitcoin regardless of risk tolerance and financial goals.
The comments on the post were also extremely bullish on Bitcoin, with some saying ""Rich dad says ‘Hodl'; poor dad says, ‘Sell now'"" and ""Not 300k. We’ll hit 1 Mil this year.""

,"Bitcoin Recently Surpassed $65,000 -- This Is Why Investors Are Excited","Just two years ago, Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies plummeted after the very public collapse of the crypto exchange FTX and soaring interest rates that triggered pessimism in the market. But in 2023, investors started returning to Bitcoin, and their optimism has caused its price to surge 174% over the past year.
A combination of optimism about the recent launch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and an upcoming halving of Bitcoin -- making it more difficult to mine the crypto -- are driving its price higher.
Here's why these two things are exciting crypto investors and a few things to keep in mind if you're considering investing in Bitcoin.
Bitcoin ETF euphoria
For most of Bitcoin's existence, the only way to benefit from the cryptocurrency's price increases was to own the coin directly. For some investors, navigating buying a digital asset and figuring out how to store it safely was a big hurdle.
Some brokerages, like Robinhood, made it easier to buy Bitcoin, but casual investors were still somewhat confused about owning digital assets. But a lot of that changed when the first Bitcoin ETF launched in January, which directly tracks the price of Bitcoin. Now, any investor can easily buy an ETF that follows the price of Bitcoin in the same way popular ETFs track the S&P 500.
Here are the benefits of Bitcoin ETFs:
You can buy it like any other stock in your brokerage account.
You can liquidate it easily, selling the shares when you no longer want them.
ETF tax rules are already in place, while crypto tax rules are still confusing.
This simplicity makes it easier for everyday investors to dip their toes in crypto investing, opening up Bitcoin to many more investors and driving the price higher.
The result is Bitcoin's price surging nearly 38% since Bitcoin ETFs launched.
Bitcoin's halving is about to happen
Bitcoin's price is also climbing because the rate at which Bitcoin is mined will be cut in half next month. This event happens about every four years, making Bitcoin twice as difficult to mine as before.
There is a theoretical maximum supply of 21 million Bitcoins, which won't be reached until around 2140. With Bitcoin becoming more difficult to mine as time goes on, it potentially makes current coins more valuable.
This is adding to the current Bitcoin optimism and likely driving the cryptocurrency higher.
There's probably more volatility ahead
Like many other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is already prone to significant price swings. Since its inception, the cryptocurrency has seen multiple pullbacks of 75% or more of its value from peak prices.

And the upcoming halving could trigger the next significant drop. JPMorgan analysts said recently that Bitcoin's price could fall to $42,000 -- a decrease of 37% from today's current price -- after the hype surrounding the halving subsides.
If you're thinking about buying a Bitcoin ETF anytime soon, here are a few things you should keep in mind:
It's best to keep crypto to 5% or less of your portfolio: Many experts recommend limiting crypto to no more than 5% of your portfolio. A smaller percentage is even better if you're new to cryptocurrencies.
Don't invest money you can't afford to lose: This is a general rule for any investment, but it's especially applicable to Bitcoin because of its volatility. Can you handle a 20% drop in Bitcoin's value? If not, you shouldn't invest that money.
Keep track of crypto tax rules: If you buy a Bitcoin ETF, the tax rules will be the same as any other ETF you own. But if you decide to own Bitcoin or any other crypto outright, you'll need to declare that when doing your taxes.
Owning Bitcoin directly or through an ETF will take part of your portfolio on a wild ride. That's not necessarily bad, but you should be prepared for the volatility and understand what you're getting into before you begin.","Just two years ago, Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies plummeted after the very public collapse of the crypto exchange FTX and soaring interest rates that triggered pessimism in the market. But in 2023, investors started returning to Bitcoin, and their optimism has caused its price to surge 174% over the past year.
A combination of optimism about the recent launch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and an upcoming halving of Bitcoin -- making it more difficult to mine the crypto -- are driving its price higher.
Here's why these two things are exciting crypto investors and a few things to keep in mind if you're considering investing in Bitcoin.
Bitcoin ETF euphoria
For most of Bitcoin's existence, the only way to benefit from the cryptocurrency's price increases was to own the coin directly. For some investors, navigating buying a digital asset and figuring out how to store it safely was a big hurdle.
Some brokerages, like Robinhood, made it easier to buy Bitcoin, but casual investors were still somewhat confused about owning digital assets. But a lot of that changed when the first Bitcoin ETF launched in January, which directly tracks the price of Bitcoin. Now, any investor can easily buy an ETF that follows the price of Bitcoin in the same way popular ETFs track the S&P 500.
Here are the benefits of Bitcoin ETFs:
You can buy it like any other stock in your brokerage account.
You can liquidate it easily, selling the shares when you no longer want them.
ETF tax rules are already in place, while crypto tax rules are still confusing.
This simplicity makes it easier for everyday investors to dip their toes in crypto investing, opening up Bitcoin to many more investors and driving the price higher.
The result is Bitcoin's price surging nearly 38% since Bitcoin ETFs launched.
Bitcoin's halving is about to happen
Bitcoin's price is also climbing because the rate at which Bitcoin is mined will be cut in half next month. This event happens about every four years, making Bitcoin twice as difficult to mine as before.
There is a theoretical maximum supply of 21 million Bitcoins, which won't be reached until around 2140. With Bitcoin becoming more difficult to mine as time goes on, it potentially makes current coins more valuable.
This is adding to the current Bitcoin optimism and likely driving the cryptocurrency higher.
There's probably more volatility ahead

,"Fundstrat's Tom Lee: Bitcoin Will Reach ""$150,000 Before Year End""","On March 5, 2024, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high (ATH), breaching the $69,000 level. This was a huge moment, considering that many were willing to count Bitcoin out when it was trading at the $15,000 level less than 15 months ago. However, some do not see Bitcoin's bullish momentum ending there.

Tom Lee is a managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat, one of the most prominent financial research firms in the world. In an interview with CNBC, Lee said that Bitcoin will ""make a bee-line back towards its long-term trend line,"" which could propel it to $150,000 before year end...and much much higher numbers in the future.""

Don't Miss:

    If you invested $100 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here’s how much you’d have today.

    About 22% of the adult population in the U.S. own a share of Bitcoin, how much would $10 get you today?

Lee is a prominent voice in the financial sector, and his opinion is valued by many. His bullish take on Bitcoin could cause traders to act, potentially propelling Bitcoin even higher.

Additionally, in the interview, Lee discusses his main reasons for why he believes that Bitcoin is so polarizing among the investment community.

First, he says that it is a generational issue. Crypto, he says, ""is being adopted and used by younger folks, Millennials and Gen Z."" He noted that it has a strong global presence, particularly among the unbanked and those without access to strong financial institutions.

His second reasoning revolves around its growth. Bitcoin started as a small project that was not used by many, meant for use among individuals. This mission contrasts with the ""traditional financial system [and] those who are used to the venture capital world or institutional access before individuals."" The innovation occurred in the opposite direction, starting with individuals before making its way to institutions, which was an issue for some.

He mentions the issue of trust. Bitcoin relies on a decentralized and distributed network to verify transactions, which means that ""Bitcoin represents trust in a trustless world."" Lee seems to be getting at an issue that is much larger than Bitcoin but is impacting the ability for Bitcoin to achieve large-scale adoption.

The comments on the interview were largely positive, with users saying that ""when Tom speaks, you listen"" and that ""Fundstrat’s Tom Lee is a National Treasure!""

,BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF Breaks Net Inflows Record; Will The Bull Run Continue?,"In early 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) allowed 10 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to begin trading in a landmark decision. The ETFs were sponsored by some of the largest asset management companies in the world, such as BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments. These companies have brought new attention and investment to Bitcoin, allowing the token to reach all-time highs.
The ETFs were designed to bridge the gap between crypto enthusiasts and stock market investors. Before, the only way to purchase Bitcoin was through a crypto brokerage or a wallet.

About 22% of the adult population in the U.S. own a share of Bitcoin, how much would $10 get you today?
The ETFs have been largely successful, propelling Bitcoin to a new all-time high of nearly $70,000 on March 5. This may be because of the huge amount of inflows that the ETFs have seen. As more people buy shares of the ETFs, the companies are forced to buy Bitcoin to keep up. This has resulted in huge amounts of buying activity for Bitcoin.
On March 5, when Bitcoin reached a new all-time high, the BlackRock ETF (IBIT) saw a record inflow of $788.3 million in a single day. This meant that BlackRock had to buy over 11,000 Bitcoins, which likely brought Bitcoin to its new high.
While BlackRock's ETF saw huge inflows, the net inflows across all ETFs were slightly less, totaling just under $650 million. This is because of the large number of sellers on Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's (GBTC) ETF, as arbitrage players are looking to exit and secure profits, as well as the high fees the ETF charge that are causing some to invest in other funds.

Some believe that the current run is in anticipation of the upcoming Bitcoin halving, which is expected to occur in April and could be a sell-the-news event.

Conversely, others have noted that the buying activity is slowly chipping away at seller liquidity and that there are only 5,000 BTC between current prices and the $80,000 level on Coinbase. Others see this bull run as just the beginning of a broader bull market that could send the price of Bitcoin into the six-figure range.
Either way, it is impossible to deny the popularity of the current Bitcoin ETFs and their impact on the market. It will be interesting to see how the dynamic changes in the coming months.

,Bitcoin 'V-Shape' Recovery Opens Way for $76K Price Target: Swissblock,"Bitcoin's sharp rebound from Tuesday's plunge indicates a start of a new rally targeting $76,000, Swissblock said.
QCP Capital forecasted that bitcoin will break higher in the near term after ""extremely impressive"" bounce.
U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs saw massive inflows during the plunge, indicating that investors bought the dip helping prices recover
Bitcoin's {{BTC}} record-setting move above $69,000 quickly turned into a bloodbath on Tuesday, but its rapid recovery to $67,000 one day later may foreshadow another imminent run for new all-time highs, according to crypto analytics firm Swissblock.

Swissblock analysts noted that with yesterday's plunge, bitcoin successfully retested the $59,000-$62,000 price area, where it recently consolidated for a week before marching on to the all-time high.
""V-recovery – and onwards towards new all-time highs,"" Swissblock said in a Wednesday Telegram update.

Singapore-based digital asset trading firm QCP Capital also forecasted an imminent leg higher for bitcoin.
""The bounce has been extremely impressive,"" QCP analysts wrote in a Wednesday market update. ""The dip was bought up very quickly and aggressively, and $60,000 proved to be a good support level."" ""With some of the leverage taken out, the path higher has now opened up and we look to a near-term break higher as the uptrend resumes immediately,"" QCP added.
U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs attracted massive inflows during Tuesday's drop, indicating that ETF investors were unfazed by the plunge and bought the dip.
The ten new ETFs combined saw $648 million in net inflows, the largest daily allocation since their debut day in Jan. 11, data compiled by BitMEX Research shows. The BlackRock iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) broke its daily record, enjoying $788 million of fresh investment and adding 12,600 BTC to the fund.
At press time, BTC was trading at $67,200, up over 7% over the past 24 hours and outperforming the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index's (CD20) 2.5% advance during the same period.","Bitcoin's sharp rebound from Tuesday's plunge indicates a start of a new rally targeting $76,000, Swissblock said.

,The Protocol: Bitcoin Cry for Help Heard,"Rosy predictions for bitcoin spot ETFs are paying off, with billions of inflows into the vehicles, helping to push the BTC price this week to a new all-time high above the old record around $69,000. The vindicated prognosticators may argue there's now ample proof that if normies have an easy way of investing in crypto, they will. The question is whether newbies fully understand the vagaries of decentralized governance of decentralized networks, or grasp the reality that the technology is still very much in its adolescence. Maybe that's the point of getting in now.

In this week's issue of The Protocol:

    Ethereum conferences like last week's ETHDenbver are now attracting a presence from Bitcoiners, Solana acolytes and Polkadot representatives – perhaps a sign of just how influential the second-largest blockchain has become.

    A maintainer of the dominant Bitcoin Core software used to run the original blockchain has acknowledged lone Bitcoin Improvement Proposal editor Luke Dashjr's call for backup.

    Top picks from the past week's Protocol Village column of blockchain project updates: Marathon Digital, Metis, Chainlink, Tea Protocol, BOB (a Bitcoin layer-2 network), Wormhole.

    More than $50M of blockchain project fundraises.

    Tron leads Token Terminal's ranking of blockchains based on daily average users.

ETHEREUM'S BIG TENT: Ethereum conferences aren't just for Ethereans anymore, CoinDesk's Sam Kessler reports. Last week's ETHDenver conference in Colorado, one of the year's largest gatherings for developers and users of the Ethereum blockchain, drew in a cross-section of the blockchain industry. The broad swath of attendees might be a testament to Ethereum's influence on other blockchain ecosystems, attracting onlookers from other crypto tribes. But it also might be a sign of rival systems looking to encroach on Ethereum's success in making blockchains more programmable, with its vibrant ecosystem of software developers looking to create new applications. Bitcoin, in the midst of a developer renaissance with the advent of its own NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi) services, had an impressive turnout of builders at the conference. So did Polkadot, the ""hub-and-spoke"" blockchain created by Gavin Wood, an Ethereum co-founder who used to market his new project as an improvement over the Ethereum model. Even Solana, the speed-focused network that's long positioned itself as an ""ETH Killer,"" had a well-attended booth at Denver's National Western Complex, the conference's venue. John Paller, the conference's founder and executive steward, told CoinDesk in an interview that there were ""probably seven or eight layer 1s that are here, and we have probably 12 layer 2s."" According to conference officials, there were 20,000 ""festival attendees.""

BITCOIN PSA: In last week's issue, we highlighted how, despite robust demand to buy bitcoin by newly approved U.S. spot ETFs, and the surging BTC price (this week surpassing the previous all-time high around $69,000), the governance of the blockchain's software is still dependent on largely volunteers, or on pro developers moonlighting – a labor of love, as it were. And the process is down to having only one editor, Luke Dashjr, to manage what he described as the ""thankless and boring job"" of handling all the new Bitcoin Improvement Proposals or ""BIPs"" that come over the transom. Well, his cries for help were heard, apparently. Ava Chow, one of the maintainers of Bitcoin Core, acknowledged in a post on the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list that it might be ""prudent for us to look at adding more BIPs editors."" According to Chow: ""this would significantly help get through the backlog of BIPs PRs, and responding to them in a timely manner to significantly reduce the friction of getting BIPs changes merged,"" adding that ""any new BIP editors should be people who have a history of following and being involved in Bitcoin development, as well as being known to evaluate proposals objectively, and of course, are willing to do the job."" As Bitcoin Optech newsletter put it dryly, ""No clear resolution has been reached.""

ALSO:

    Independent U.S. presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy told the crowd at ETHDenver, ""After I went to the Miami conference, I bought a bunch of bitcoin for my kids, and I'm going to buy some Ethereum after I leave this place.""

    Bitcoiners have struck a significant victory in their push to strike down the U.S. Department of Energy’s statistics unit’s “emergency” bitcoin mining order. According to court documents, the Energy Information Administration is dropping its mandatory survey sent to hundreds of miners in favor of the proper notice and comment period required by law.

    Bernstein Research wrote in a report that it would not be surprising to see global asset managers considering a possible DeFi exchange-traded fund (ETF) and active DeFi funds, noting that Uniswap, Aave, Maker, GMX, Synthetix and Sushi account for six of the 10 top revenue-generating blockchain protocols.

    Some $200.5 million has been lost to hacks and rug pulls in 2024 year-to-date, a 15.4% increase when compared with the same period in 2023, according to the ""Crypto Losses in February 2024"" report from Immunefi, a bug bounty and security services platform.

    A single ""monke"" from the NodeMonkes collection of Bitcoin Ordinals inscriptions sold for 17 BTC ($1.08 million) – called ""Alien Hoodie"" or #2769 – featuring some very low-res pixelation. 
    Marathon Digital Holdings, a publicly-traded bitcoin mining firm, disclosed it has been incubating Anduro, a new programmable, multi-chain layer-2 network atop the Bitcoin blockchain. It's a ""platform built on the Bitcoin network that allows for the creation of multiple sidechains,"" according to a press release.

    Metis, an Ethereum layer-2 network, plans to integrate Chainlink's interoperability solution, Chainlink CCIP, ""as its canonical token bridge infrastructure, enabling the Metis ecosystem to expand its cross-chain footprint, enhance user and developer experience and accelerate adoption,"" according to the team.

    Tea Protocol, founded by Max Howell, the creator of Homebrew's open-source software package management, said that his ""latest project leverages blockchain technology to address longstanding challenges in OSS development, marking a significant step towards a more sustainable and equitable ecosystem for software creators.""

    BOB, a Bitcoin layer-2 blockchain project, announced its innovative hybrid solution between Bitcoin and Ethereum at their ""Bitcoin Renaissance"" event, a side event of ETHDenver attended by 1,500 individuals, according to the team: ""This solution introduces an ETH-settled rollup that leverages an advanced merged mining technique to inherit Bitcoin's PoW security. Looking ahead, BOB plans to enable settlements on both Bitcoin, via BitVM, and Ethereum.

    Wormhole, a protocol for communication between blockchains, just revealed ""Wormhole Native Token Transfers,"" a new framework for making any token multichain, securely and efficiently, according to the team: ""NTT introduces an open, flexible, and composable framework for transferring native tokens across blockchains while preserving their intrinsic properties. Compared to wrapped assets, NTT is simpler, decentralized, marking a significant stride forward for interoperability.""
Ethereum developers are gearing up for the blockchain's next big upgrade happening next week, called Dencun.

It's supposed to issue in a new era of lower costs for ""layer-2"" blockchains, including so-called rollup networks that aim to offer faster and cheaper transactions than on the main blockchain. But just how much lower?

Dencun will be the biggest upgrade – technically a ""hard fork"" in blockchain parlance – that the network will undergo in almost a year.

The main component in Dencun is called EIP-4844, or more commonly “proto-danksharding,” which will bring in a new type of transaction class that reduces the costs of publishing data of transactions on rollups, through the introduction of data “blobs.” These blobs are a separate place in a transaction where rollup networks or other protocols could temporarily stash data – sometimes described as a ""side car"" that doesn't take up space in the main car.

As a result of more blobs, the costs for these layer-2 networks to stash data on Ethereum will be significantly cheaper, and the reduction is likely to trickle down to users in the form of lower fees.

But how exactly it will all shake out is still ambiguous, according to many Ethereum experts. We asked leading layer-2 teams, including Polygon, Arbitrum, StarkWare and Coinbase's Base, for their predictions post-Dencun.
    Sahara, the latest startup to blend the worlds of crypto and artificial intelligence, says it can help workers and companies get compensated for their knowledge, expertise and data in the age of AI. The Los Angeles-based startup has raised $6 million in a seed funding round led by Polychain Capital. The round also included participation from Samsung Next, Matrix Partners, Motherson Group and Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of the Polygon blockchain ecosystem. The project was co-founded by Sean Ren, an AI researcher and tenured member of the school’s computer science faculty at the University of Southern California (USC).

    Taiko, a layer-2 scaling solution provider for the Ethereum blockchain, has raised $15 million in a series A funding round, adding to the growing amount of investment allocations to crypto projects from venture-capital firms. The fundraise was led by Lightspeed Faction, Hashed, Generative Ventures and Token Bay Capital, according to a press release.

    Baanx, a cryptocurrency payments specialist authorized by the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), has raised a $20 million Series A funding round, the company said on Tuesday.

    Stack, a platform for creating and managing point systems, has raised $3M from Archetype, Coinbase Ventures and other VCs and angels to bring points, loyalty programs and identity primitives on-chain, according to the team.

    Synnax, a protocol that generates AI-driven credit intelligence and ratings for the digital asset industry, announced a $1 million pre-seed funding round, led by No Limit Holdings.

our weekly The Protocol podcast","Rosy predictions for bitcoin spot ETFs are paying off, with billions of inflows into the vehicles, helping to push the BTC price this week to a new all-time high above the old record around $69,000. The vindicated prognosticators may argue there's now ample proof that if normies have an easy way of investing in crypto, they will. The question is whether newbies fully understand the vagaries of decentralized governance of decentralized networks, or grasp the reality that the technology is still very much in its adolescence. Maybe that's the point of getting in now.

In this week's issue of The Protocol:

    Ethereum conferences like last week's ETHDenbver are now attracting a presence from Bitcoiners, Solana acolytes and Polkadot representatives – perhaps a sign of just how influential the second-largest blockchain has become.

    A maintainer of the dominant Bitcoin Core software used to run the original blockchain has acknowledged lone Bitcoin Improvement Proposal editor Luke Dashjr's call for backup.

    Top picks from the past week's Protocol Village column of blockchain project updates: Marathon Digital, Metis, Chainlink, Tea Protocol, BOB (a Bitcoin layer-2 network), Wormhole.

    More than $50M of blockchain project fundraises.

    Tron leads Token Terminal's ranking of blockchains based on daily average users.

ETHEREUM'S BIG TENT: Ethereum conferences aren't just for Ethereans anymore, CoinDesk's Sam Kessler reports. Last week's ETHDenver conference in Colorado, one of the year's largest gatherings for developers and users of the Ethereum blockchain, drew in a cross-section of the blockchain industry. The broad swath of attendees might be a testament to Ethereum's influence on other blockchain ecosystems, attracting onlookers from other crypto tribes. But it also might be a sign of rival systems looking to encroach on Ethereum's success in making blockchains more programmable, with its vibrant ecosystem of software developers looking to create new applications. Bitcoin, in the midst of a developer renaissance with the advent of its own NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi) services, had an impressive turnout of builders at the conference.

,"Bitcoin Rebounds as $150K Target for 2024 Comes in View
","    The selling pressure was likely driven by profit-taking and miners offloading some bitcoin holdings.

    Solana’s SOL, Cardano’s ADA, ether and meme coins, started to reverse some of Tuesday’s losses.

Buying demand and a reset in funding rates for perpetuals has buoyed bitcoin {{BTC}} prices early Wednesday, fueling a broader-market recovery.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency tumbled over 7% on Tuesday after briefly touching all-time highs, causing a market-wide sell-off and more than $1 billion in liquidations amid the volatility. It dropped to as low as $60,800 but neared $67,000 in Asian morning hours – indicating resilience.

Some observers said the selling pressure was likely driven by profit-taking at historical highs and miners offloading some of their bitcoin holdings. Data shows that inflows in spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) remained strong, with BlackRock amassing over $760 million on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, some market analysts said lofty price targets for bitcoin remained in view as April’s anticipated halving event, which reduces mining rewards in half, approaches.

“As demand from bitcoin ETFs, with $500 million in daily average inflows, continues to outstrip new production, we may see bitcoin’s ongoing surge continue,” Alex Adelman, CEO of bitcoin rewards application Lolli, shared in an email.

“Following the Halving, increased scarcity and strong demand from retail and institutional investors will likely push bitcoin’s price even higher. Based on historical trends following the Halving, bitcoin’s price could top $150,000 in the next year.”

Some developers say Bitcoin fundamentals are stronger this cycle compared to the previous ones, pointing to the introduction of Ordinals technology and their adoption.

""New innovations such as Ordinals, digital collectibles (NFTs) that are inscribed in the Bitcoin blockchain have driven $3.6 billion in BTC payments over the last 6 months alone,"" shared Stijn Paumen, founder of crypto payments firm Helio, in a message to CoinDesk. ""If this trajectory continues we'll see global adoption of crypto as a mainstream method of a payment in the coming 4-year BTC cycle.""

Major tokens, such as Solana’s SOL, Cardano’s ADA, ether {{ETH}} and meme coins, started to reverse Tuesday’s losses, rising as much as 5% in the past hour on bitcoin’s strength.

Dog-themed tokens dogecoin {{DOGE}} and shiba inu {{SHIB}} saw sell-offs of more than 15% on Tuesday but did not rebound alongside the other major tokens.",,"The selling pressure was likely driven by profit-taking and miners offloading some bitcoin holdings.

Bitcoin's price increased by 45.9% last month. On top of that, the three Bitcoin miners all reported fourth-quarter results in February, and each report either boosted or busted the crypto mining sector's returns to some degree.
The dual forces driving Bitcoin's recent surge

First, Bitcoin is sandwiched between two robust price-boosting catalysts.

The 11 Bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that were approved in January were a drag on Bitcoin prices at first, but their active buying of digital currency coins has turned into a tailwind recently. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (NYSEMKT: GBTC) has dropped from $28.6 billion to $27.5 billion of assets under management, as investors seek ETFs with leaner fee structures. On the other hand, iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ: IBIT), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (NYSEMKT: FBTC), Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKB), and Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (NYSEMKT: BITB) all started from zero on Jan. 12. Today, the Bitcoin assets of the four largest ETFs not named Grayscale add up to a cool $23 billion. That's a hefty amount of newfound demand, reshuffling the location of roughly 344,000 Bitcoin coins on short notice.

On the flipside, the next halving of Bitcoin mining rewards is scheduled for late April. These pre-planned events take place once every four years, give or take a couple of months, shaking up the economics of Bitcoin mining and enforcing the lifetime limit of 21 million coins, max. Every halving so far has inspired huge price gains over the following 12 to 18 months, and the next crypto winter starts after those post-halving peaks. Past patterns are no guarantee of future market behavior, but this particular template is more reliable than most. I'm talking about hard-coded changes to how the Bitcoin blockchain network runs, with direct and predictable effects on the digital currency's market price. And the next one is coming up in about six weeks.

So Bitcoin is on a roll, providing plenty of fuel for related stocks such as the crypto miners listed earlier.

What about those earnings reports, though? Here's a brief overview of how the three miners performed, and how Wall Street reacted the next day:

As you can see, each earnings report pushed the related stock significantly higher or lower, depending on the quality of the results. In particular, Marathon's negative earnings threw ice water on the whole mining industry -- the three miners under my microscope all fell 7% or more the next day.
Throwing more hardware at the crypto mining business

The crypto miner volatility isn't going away anytime soon. Riot, CleanSpark, and Marathon are investing every penny they can spare in more mining facilities and expanded machine parks.

Riot's hash rate (a measure of the computing power it focuses on Bitcoin mining operations) is expected to increase from 31.5 exahashes per second (EH/s) at the end of 2023 to 40.8 EH/s one year later. Marathon's computing power should rise from 24.7 to 36 EH/s over the same period. CleanSpark is a bit smaller with just 10.1 EH/s in December, aiming for 20 EH/s by the end of June and 32 EH/s by year end.

Riot maintains a squeaky-clean balance sheet with zero long-term debt and $597 million in cash equivalents. Marathon recently paid down its debt balance from $750 million to $325 million while tripling its cash reserves. CleanSpark sits between those extremes with a small cash account and near-zero debt.

In light of these balance sheet differences, Riot strikes me as the safest of these inherently risky stocks, and its stock has indeed been less volatile in recent months. Marathon and CleanSpark come with greater financial risk, amplifying the highest highs and lowest lows along the way.

All things considered, I'd rather own Bitcoin or one of the spot-price ETFs than any of the crypto miners. I just get more sleep that way. Your mileage may vary, and all three stocks stand far below their three-year highs after February's jumps.

Just promise you'll be careful out there, dear reader, making small investments in these volatile tickers as part of a properly diversified portfolio. I would not recommend betting the literal farm on any of the Bitcoin miners, nor on Bitcoin itself.

,"JPMorgan: Bitcoin's Surge Could Raise Concerns at the Fed, Rate Cuts Might be Delayed","Bitcoin's recent price surge to new highs has some experts worried, including JPMorgan Chase's chief market strategist Marko Kolanovic. In a research note, Kolanovic reportedly expressed concern that the rally in Bitcoin and other digital assets could hinder the Federal Reserve's ability to loosen monetary policy.

Kolanovic argues that Bitcoin's jump above $60,000 ""may keep monetary policy higher for longer."" His reasoning is that premature interest rate cuts could further inflate asset prices or reignite inflation.

Bitcoin's recent performance stands in contrast to the broader market reaction to the Fed's decision to maintain current interest rates. While stocks and other assets dipped on the news, Bitcoin remained relatively stable. This stability comes after a strong start to the year, with Bitcoin currently up nearly 9% and briefly touching a new all-time high on major exchanges.

The confluence of factors driving Bitcoin's price increase includes the anticipated loosening of monetary policy, the success of Bitcoin ETFs, and the upcoming Bitcoin halving – an event historically linked to price increases. However, the asset's volatility and potential to overheat are cause for concerns, potentially delaying the policy changes some investors are hoping for.","Bitcoin's recent price surge to new highs has some experts worried, including JPMorgan Chase's chief market strategist Marko Kolanovic.

,First Leveraged Bitcoin ETF Nears $1B in Assets,"The Volatility Shares 2X Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX) is surging, sending assets under management in the fund close to the vaunted $1 billion level.

Since the start of the year, BITX, the first ETF to offer leveraged exposure to bitcoin, is up an incredible 124%, just over double the 61% gain for bitcoin. The cryptocurrency briefly surpassed $69,000 this week, topping the previous record high from November 2021.

BITX uses CME bitcoin futures contracts to get its exposure and was launched in June 2023, seven months before the monumental SEC approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S.

Like most leveraged ETFs, BITX is designed with aggressive traders in mind. Well-timed trades in the ETF can lead to massive returns—just as the fund has delivered over the past eight months.

But ill-timed trades can lead to enormous losses that are compounded by the performance decay that comes from daily rebalancing.

So far, investors haven’t had to worry about the downside. It’s been straight up for BITX since its launch, a windfall for the traders who have thrown money into the ETF.

Since its debut, $541 million has flowed into BITX, with $402 million of that coming since the start of 2024.

Those inflows combined with the fund’s stellar performance pushed assets under management in BITX to $914 million on Wednesday.
7th Biggest ETF Targeting Bitcoin

That makes BITX the seventh-largest ETF targeting bitcoin and the second-largest bitcoin ETF that uses futures, after the $2.9 billion ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO).

BITX’s success has caught the eye of competitors. On February 22, Valkyrie launched a rival product called the Valkyrie Bitcoin Futures Leveraged Strategy ETF (BTFX), which currently has $27 million in AUM.

ProShares, Direxion and T-Rex have also filed with the SEC to launch leveraged bitcoin ETFs, though BITX’s first mover advantage probably means that it will remain the largest fund in the category for a long time.

,Bitcoin’s black swan event: How the return of Satoshi could pose a $75 billion threat,"Bitcoin is back on top. This week, the original cryptocurrency cracked its all-time high, fueled by new ETFs backed by BlackRock and others that have elevated its status as a mainstream investment. That doesn’t mean, of course, that Bitcoin is totally safe. Aside from its historic volatility, Bitcoin is exposed to a few unique risks that are highly unlikely but potentially devastating should they materialize. The biggest of these is the return of its pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, who controls a vast hoard of Bitcoins from the currency’s earliest days, and who could shock the market in unprecedented ways.

It is widely assumed Satoshi will never return, but recent events—including a mysterious $1.2 million deposit to one of their wallets and an ongoing U.K. trial focused on their identity—are a reminder that unlikely does not mean impossible. Here’s a closer look at the odds Bitcoin’s creator could come back—and what it would mean if they did.
Satoshi’s fortune

Satoshi Nakamoto first flirted with fame with the publication of a white paper laying out the case for Bitcoin in 2008. After that, he or she or they was active in early online Bitcoin forums, and regularly emailed other developers until 2011 before going dark. Satoshi briefly surfaced one final time in 2014 to refute a news story that professed to discover their identity, but it’s been crickets ever since.

In disappearing from the scene, Satoshi also left untouched a large trove of Bitcoin wallets. These were amassed during a time when Bitcoin traded for less than $1 and when each new piece added to the blockchain yielded 50 coins (versus the three it will yield beginning next month). The transparent nature of the blockchain makes it possible to make a very good guess as to which wallets Satoshi controlled.

“We estimate Satoshi’s funds total 1.124 million Bitcoin across about 36,000 wallets. That total has not changed over time,” the forensics firm Chainalysis told Fortune.

The company added that the wallets have been “dusted” with minimal amounts from time to time, which reflects the fact that, because wallet addresses are public, anyone can send Bitcoin to them.

In January, however, one of the Satoshi wallets received a gift that was decidedly not minimal—around $1.2 million worth of Bitcoin. The reason for the donation is a mystery. It’s possible it was simply a tribute by a wealthy crypto lover to mark Bitcoin’s 15th anniversary, but others have speculated more ominously that the size of the gift reflected an attempt by a governmental tax authority to ensnare Satoshi by giving authorities legal cause to issue subpoenas.

But even if this were the case, authorities would have to know whom to subpoena—raising the long-running question of who Satoshi is. Even 15 years later, the topic surfaces in the media on a semi-regular basis, most recently as the result of a pretender named Craig Wright who’s currently in midst of a trial in which he’s seeking to have a U.K. judge rule that he invented Bitcoin.

Although Wright is clearly not Satoshi, the trial has obliged an early Bitcoin developer to furnish hundreds of emails between him and Satoshi. While the emails contain no smoking guns as to the latter’s identity, they do furnish a heap of additional evidence in the form of time stamps as well as quirks in spelling and syntax.

These additional clues are likely to reinforce the strongest existing hypothesis: that Satoshi is the libertarian polymath Nick Szabo, who likely created Bitcoin while working closely with Hal Finney, the late cryptographer who had his body cryogenically frozen—and whose interest in Bitcoin may have stemmed in part from wanting to have access to money if he returned to life.

While mainstream speculation tends to overlook the Szabo-Finney theory in favor of more familiar names (Elon Musk is currently a fashionable choice) most of those involved in crypto since the early days will quietly concede the theory is true. The topic is somewhat taboo, however, among longtime Bitcoin believers—both because they prefer to treat the currency’s origin story as religious mystery, and because of a consensus that nothing good would come from exposing Satoshi.

As for Satoshi deciding to come forward on their own, the chances of that are extremely unlikely. Pete Rizzo, a Bitcoin historian who was an early editor-in-chief at CoinDesk, tells Fortune that Satoshi’s reemergence is about as likely as “an asteroid hitting the earth”—with the odds further declining the more time passes.

Rizzo is likely correct for two reasons. The first is ideological: Satoshi was a fervent believer in a decentralized system of money and, for Bitcoin to succeed, he had to remove himself from the picture. To return would be akin to proclaiming himself a king or, worse in the eyes of crypto believers, a central banker. The other reason Satoshi is highly unlikely to reveal himself is more practical: Doing so would attract a global swarm of criminals, crackpots, and tax inspectors—and who needs that?

The fact that Satoshi won’t voluntarily reveal himself doesn’t, however, eliminate the risk that a state authority could try to coerce him or one of his associates into disclosing who created Bitcoin. But given that 15 years have elapsed—and the fact that Satoshi is likely too wily to be caught this way—also makes this scenario improbable.

Some have also raised the possibility that Satoshi could return in order to exert control over Bitcoin’s core code. That scenario, however, is all but impossible given the decentralized way the currency is maintained, and for the simple reason that if Satoshi had an ideological objection to how Bitcoin has evolved, they would have spoken up by now.

All of this, though, doesn’t account for a final wild card: Satoshi’s eventual death.
A dead man’s switch?

Satoshi may be a true believer in the decentralized financial project known as Bitcoin, but he is also a human who very likely has family and loved ones. And like anyone with a large fortune, he’s likely to make arrangements to pass on his wealth.

This raises the question of what will happen to all of Satoshi’s Bitcoins—a fortune estimated to be at least $75 billion—when he passes. Seth Ginns, a partner at the prominent crypto investment firm CoinFund, says he has given the matter some thought—and made a guess at the most likely outcome.

According to Ginns, Satoshi likely controls a number of other wallets from Bitcoin’s early days that are not counted among the cluster associated with him as assessed by Chainalysis and other forensic companies. Ginns suggests that Satoshi will quietly disburse these to his loved ones, and likely has done so already.

What if Ginns’s guess is wrong though? What would happen if Satoshi now, or after his death, chose to liquidate his entire stash (“dump his bags” in crypto slang)? The mass unloading of over 1 million Bitcoins would certainly roil the market and tank prices.

Ginns, however, predicts that the market would absorb the shock and, in time, become even stronger since the selloff would result in Bitcoin becoming even more decentralized. But he also raised another intriguing scenario: that Satoshi has a so-called dead man’s switch to announce his death.

The idea of a dead man’s switch is pretty simple. It could involve a monthly or even yearly online activity—sending an email, updating a website, or whatever—that, if not performed, would trigger an automated scenario to occur. In the case of Satoshi, that could be an email from his long abandoned email address or an update to the original Bitcoin forum that he has died and elected to burn the keys to his wallets.

If this were to occur, Ginns says, the reaction in the market would likely be euphoria and a massive surge in the price as investors received confirmation Satoshi’s massive fortune was gone forever.

All of this is hypothetical, of course, as right now no one really knows for sure who Satoshi is or what—if anything—they plan to do with their huge stash of Bitcoins. The fact remains, however, that in assessing the risks of holding Bitcoin, investors must account for the future actions—and death—of its creator—and potentially a $75 billion swing.

These additional clues are likely to reinforce the strongest existing hypothesis: that Satoshi is the libertarian polymath Nick Szabo, who likely created Bitcoin while working closely with Hal Finney, the late cryptographer who had his body cryogenically frozen—and whose interest in Bitcoin may have stemmed in part from wanting to have access to money if he returned to life. While mainstream speculation tends to overlook the Szabo-Finney theory in favor of more familiar names (Elon Musk is currently a fashionable choice) most of those involved in crypto since the early days will quietly concede the theory is true. The topic is somewhat taboo, however, among longtime Bitcoin believers—both because they prefer to treat the currency`s origin story as religious mystery, and because of a consensus that nothing good would come from exposing Satoshi. Pete Rizzo, a Bitcoin historian who was an early editor-in-chief at CoinDesk, tells Fortune that Satoshi`s reemergence is about as likely as “an asteroid hitting the earth”—with the odds further declining the more time passes. The other reason Satoshi is highly unlikely to reveal himself is more practical: Doing so would attract a global swarm of criminals, crackpots, and tax inspectors—and who needs that? But given that 15 years have elapsed—and the fact that Satoshi is likely too wily to be caught this way—also makes this scenario improbable. Some have also raised the possibility that Satoshi could return in order to exert control over Bitcoin`s core code. That scenario, however, is all but impossible given the decentralized way the currency is maintained, and for the simple reason that if Satoshi had an ideological objection to how Bitcoin has evolved, they would have spoken up by now. Satoshi may be a true believer in the decentralized financial project known as Bitcoin, but he is also a human who very likely has family and loved ones. And like anyone with a large fortune, he`s likely to make arrangements to pass on his wealth. This raises the question of what will happen to all of Satoshi`s Bitcoins—a fortune estimated to be at least 75 million. All of this is hypothetical, of course, as right now no one really knows for sure who Satoshi is or what—if anything—they plan to do with their huge stash of Bitcoins. The fact remains, however, that in assessing the risks of holding Bitcoin, investors must account for the future actions—and death—of its creator—and potentially a $75 billion swing.

Hello and welcome back to the TechCrunch Crypto newsletter.

To start things off, here’s a shameless plug: I went on Yahoo Finance last week for a roundtable discussion alongside Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein, CoinDesk Indices managing director Andy Baehr and Matt Kohrs, host of the crypto-centric Matt Kohrs show.

We discussed spot bitcoin ETFs, regulation of digital assets and what the next era for crypto could look like. Watch here.

It was an eventful week in the crypto world: bitcoin’s price hit a new all-time high on Tuesday, Spain’s data protection authority temporarily banned Worldcoin and Binance raised eyebrows after making a crypto perfume to celebrate International Women’s Day.

Curious? Check out more below.
This week in web3

    Bitcoin hits new all-time high passing $69,000 for first time since November 2021

    Binance made crypto perfume in a baffling attempt to woo women

    Worldcoin hit with temporary ban in Spain over privacy concerns

    OpenSea’s partnership with Coachella is a sign that NFTs can be more than profile pictures

    Binance to halt naira services amid ongoing regulatory probe in Nigeria

Crunching numbers

As mentioned, this week the crypto space saw all-time highs for bitcoin. But the grandfather of cryptocurrencies has since fallen about 3%, from around $69,000 to $67,000, at the time of publication. Still, bitcoin is up 6.5% on the week and 56% on the month. The second-largest crypto, ether, is up 9.7% on the week to $3,800, according to CoinMarketCap data. The total crypto market cap increased 7.7% during the same time frame to $2.53 trillion.

Smaller tokens have also gained a lot of traction this past week. Solana-based dog-themed memecoins saw renewed interest after hype rose in December. Bonk and dogwifhat increased 15% and 115%, respectively, on the week. Separately, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, rose 19% and 125%, respectively, during the same time period.

Which begs the question…who let the dogs out?
Our favorite ‘Crypto Twitter’ post

Excuse the language, but if you didn’t realize how large some memecoins become…maybe now you will. When this X post was written, dogwifhat (WIF) had a market capitalization three times the size of Spirit Airlines’.

For what it’s worth, it has declined since, but dogwifhat (WIF) has a market capitalization of $1.8 billion, which is still 213% higher than Spirit Airlines.

The latest pod

Chain Reaction is doing a monthly series diving into different topics and themes in crypto. This month we’re focusing on blockchain and AI integrations.

For this week’s episode, I interviewed Dee Goens, the co-founder of Zora.

Zora is a platform and protocol that helps developers and creators bring their ideas on chain and on Ethereum through an open and shared environment. The platform has minted more than million NFTs, and has over $300 million in secondary sales and about 1 million unique collectors, according to its website.

Goens previously worked at Coinbase for 2.5 years doing risk management, operations and brand partnerships. Before that, he analyzed emerging technologies’ risk with a focus in blockchains at KPMG.

As we just wrapped up our NFT series for February, Goens is the perfect guest to transition from that topic to AI and blockchains given Zora’s focus on bringing AI on-chain.

In a first for Chain Reaction, we also minted this podcast on Zora’s platform, which you can check out here.

Jacquelyn and Goens discuss how Zora envisions blockchains and AI working together, the roles they can play for NFT creators and what the platform’s developers and community members want more of.

,Robert Kiyosaki: Not Buying Bitcoin Is 'The Biggest Mistake You Can Make',"Robert Kiyosaki is a legend in the financial industry for his book ""Rich Dad Poor Dad."" The book has shown many the path to financial independence and cemented Kiyosaki as someone worth listening to, selling more than 40 million copies across 100 countries.

When Kiyosaki wrote the book in 2002, Bitcoin was not invented. However, his opinion on the token is valued, and many watch his social media accounts for advice and predictions.

His social media following got just that in a March 6 post on X. In the post, Kiyosaki says, ""BITCOIN on fire. The biggest mistake you can make is to procrastinate. Important to start, even if only for $500. Next stop $300,000 per BC in 2024.""

Don't Miss:

    If you invested $100 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here’s how much you’d have today.

    About 22% of the adult population in the U.S. own a share of Bitcoin, how much would $10 get you today?

The post comes one day after Bitcoin reached a new ATH of just over $69,000. However, new highs do not scare Kiyosaki at all. The outspoken Bitcoin bull sees this run as only the beginning for Bitcoin in 2024.

YTD, Bitcoin is up more than 56% and is up 155% in the past 6 months. Despite this, Kiyosaki sees room for another increase of more than 300% before the end of the year. At that price, the market cap of Bitcoin would be approximately $5.5 trillion, more than that of Apple and NVIDIA combined.

It may seem a bit outlandish when you put it that way, but some see a legitimate path to those levels. If the inflation continues to taper and the Federal Reserve begins cutting rates, combined with the upcoming halving and continued inflows into ETFs, buying activity could be sustained throughout the remainder of 2024. However, this trajectory would require lots of moving parts to fall into place. Though unlikely, a $300,000 Bitcoin is not out of the question in 2024.

Looking back at past Bitcoin cycles, most have followed a similar pattern of barely reaching new all-time highs (ATHs) before falling back slightly and then reaching new highs around a year later. If Bitcoin were to follow this pattern again, investors could see a slight pullback in the near term before Bitcoin creates new highs in the next several months.

Additionally, Kiyosaki makes a good point about the practicality of Bitcoin investing. You can invest any amount of money into Bitcoin, ranging from a few dollars to billions. This factor allows anyone with extra cash to buy Bitcoin regardless of risk tolerance and financial goals.

The comments on the post were also extremely bullish on Bitcoin, with some saying ""Rich dad says ‘Hodl'; poor dad says, ‘Sell now'"" and ""Not 300k. We’ll hit 1 Mil this year.""

Bitcoin seems to be at an inflection point after reaching new highs. Will it continue to rise or see a pullback in the coming months? According to Kiyosaki, the Bitcoin bull run of 2024 is just getting started.

,Bitcoin Has a Feel-Good Energy Story,"The price of Bitcoin set a new all time high this week, crossing the $69,000 mark on Tuesday before falling back down to around $67,500 by Thursday afternoon. That almost certainly means Bitcoin’s energy usage is rising, too — although any chance of getting a precise idea of how much, even just in the U.S., may be delayed for months. Last week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration agreed to stop collecting data on crypto mining operations after a federal court in Texas put a halt on the project until the EIA goes through a more fulsome approval process.

That Bitcoin eats up a lot of power is beyond dispute. Bitcoin mining involves solving increasingly complex math problems, which at this point requires vast amounts of computing power; using outside data, the EIA estimated that crypto accounts for around 2% of the nation’s total electricity use. Both the industry’s electricity usage and how it participates in electricity markets have been subject to criticism from Democratic lawmakers, who have pushed for more information-gathering. If the price of Bitcoin continues to climb, that skepticism could ratchet up.

“There is a very direct relationship between the value of what is being mined by the miners and how much is being spent on electricity,” Alex De Vries, a cryptocurrency and energy researcher, told me.

An extensive New York Times investigation last year found that large-scale mining operations were “putting immense pressure on the power grid,” and that “their operations can create costs — including higher electricity bills and enormous carbon pollution — for everyone around them.” According to the University of Cambridge Judge Business School, Bitcoin’s energy consumption has risen about 50% in the past year, from an annualized rate of around 110 terawatt-hours a year just over 163 TWh, comparable to the electricity production of Ukraine or Pakistan. (That is, of course, an estimate, based on a model derived from the performance of mining hardware and the assumption that miners only operate with hardware that allows them to mine Bitcoin profitably.)

With all the attention on consumption and emissions, Bitcoin miners have been eager to portray themselves as, if not quite the goodies, at least not the baddies.

“The industry as a whole has a good story to tell about the energy piece,” Tom Mapes, president of a newly formed industry group called the Digital Energy Council, told me. He also told me that I “have to be realistic about it. We do use a lot of power — not to say that using power in every facet is bad.”

The feel-good Bitcoin energy story goes something like this: Crypto miners are always ready to use energy at the right price — and to shut things down at the right price, too. “We have the ability as a bulk power user of our size has the ability to flex load like no another,” Mapes said. “Datacenters cannot flex load like this. We can be built in as a tool to work within constraints of these grids.”

If a mining facility is co-located with an energy resource, it can be there to purchase power production that might otherwise be curtailed because there isn’t enough transmission capacity to get it to other customers. It can also be a buyer of first resort for a newly developed generator or it can keep an old one in business, as Bitcoin mining has with some fossil fuel generators.

“You tend to see Bitcoin miners anywhere there’s stranded energy and excess power,” said Margot Paez, a fellow at the Bitcoin Policy Institute. There are some examples of crypto mining co-located with renewables, but that does not always mean that the power they use is entirely renewable. There’s also a crypto mining operation set up at a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania, adjacent to what will be an Amazon Web Services data center.

The main way crypto operations interact with the grid is not by supporting any particular resource, though, but rather by being flexible about when they operate. Shutting off when demand is high can be quite lucrative — sometimes even more so than the crypto mining itself.

Riot Networks, a mining company with extensive operations in Texas and a plaintiff in the EIA record collection suit, has become a flashpoint for crypto’s interaction with the electricity markets precisely because it eagerly shares data with investors and the public about its participation in programs to maintain grid stability. In August, when demand hit record highs and Texas consumers were asked to conserve energy, Riot reported $8.6 million in revenue from selling Bitcoins it had mined and $31.6 million either from selling power it had bought for a prearranged price back to the grid at the higher market price or from incentive payments for being willing to power down during demand spikes.

The company’s chief executive said that last August “was a landmark month for Riot in showcasing the benefits of our unique power strategy.” (Of the 34 large Bitcoin mining operations in the New York Times investigation, Riot was the largest and had the most fossil fuel consumption attributed to it.)

But that was then and this is now. The revenues Riot is deriving from Bitcoin mining are likely substantially greater than they were five or six months ago, as the price of Bitcoin has almost doubled. The company has told investors that it costs around $7,500 to mine a single Bitcoin, which could mean that it and other crypto miners operating strategically in the electricity market will be less willing to sell power back to the grid or turn off during demand spikes.

If you’re thinking this all sounds a lot like the conversation around demand response, well, so was I. Demand response is something climate people love to talk about. They want consumers to get paid for using less power when demand spikes, and they think it’s really neat that you can charge an electric car overnight when demand is low and want you to be able to sell that power back to the grid when demand gets high.

Putting energy consumers near renewables and other non-carbon-generating energy sources that can absorb excess power when renewable production is “too high” for the grid is something you hear about a lot with, say, hydrogen production or energy storage. Why let that energy go to waste when we could incentivize people to store it, instead?

But an electrolyzer or a battery is not just a clever way to figure out how to deal with the peaks and valleys of variable renewable energy resources like wind and solar, it’s also potentially a key component of a decarbonized energy system. It doesn’t just consume non-carbon energy, it can store and transfer carbon-free energy as well.

Crypto, on the other hand, takes energy, renewable or not, and turns it into money. It’s a greedy and flexible consumer of electricity, and there are market designs where non-carbon generators would be happy to work with such a consumer. But from the perspective of the energy system, a consumer is all it will ever be.

That almost certainly means Bitcoin’s energy usage is rising, too — although any chance of getting a precise idea of how much, even just in the U.S., may be delayed for months. Last week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration agreed to stop collecting data on crypto mining operations after a federal court in Texas put a halt on the project until the EIA goes through a more fulsome approval process.

That Bitcoin eats up a lot of power is beyond dispute. Bitcoin mining involves solving increasingly complex math problems, which at this point requires vast amounts of computing power; using outside data, the EIA estimated that crypto accounts for around 2% of the nation’s total electricity use. Both the industry’s electricity usage and how it participates in electricity markets have been subject to criticism from Democratic lawmakers, who have pushed for more information-gathering. If the price of Bitcoin continues to climb, that skepticism could ratchet up.

“There is a very direct relationship between the value of what is being mined by the miners and how much is being spent on electricity,” Alex De Vries, a cryptocurrency and energy researcher, told me.

An extensive New York Times investigation last year found that large-scale mining operations were “putting immense pressure on the power grid,” and that “their operations can create costs — including higher electricity bills and enormous carbon pollution — for everyone around them.” According to the University of Cambridge Judge Business School, Bitcoin’s energy consumption has risen about 50% in the past year, from an annualized rate of around 110 terawatt-hours a year just over 163 TWh, comparable to the electricity production of Ukraine or Pakistan. (That is, of course, an estimate, based on a model derived from the performance of mining hardware and the assumption that miners only operate with hardware that allows them to mine Bitcoin profitably.)

With all the attention on consumption and emissions, Bitcoin miners have been eager to portray themselves as, if not quite the goodies, at least not the baddies.

“The industry as a whole has a good story to tell about the energy piece,” Tom Mapes, president of a newly formed industry group called the Digital Energy Council, told me. He also told me that I “have to be realistic about it. We do use a lot of power — not to say that using power in every facet is bad.”

The feel-good Bitcoin energy story goes something like this: Crypto miners are always ready to use energy at the right price — and to shut things down at the right price, too. “We have the ability as a bulk power user of our size has the ability to flex load like no another,” Mapes said. “Datacenters cannot flex load like this. We can be built in as a tool to work within constraints of these grids.”

If a mining facility is co-located with an energy resource, it can be there to purchase power production that might otherwise be curtailed because there isn’t enough transmission capacity to get it to other customers. It can also be a buyer of first resort for a newly developed generator or it can keep an old one in business, as Bitcoin mining has with some fossil fuel generators.

“You tend to see Bitcoin miners anywhere there’s stranded energy and excess power,” said Margot Paez, a fellow at the Bitcoin Policy Institute. There are some examples of crypto mining co-located with renewables, but that does not always mean that the power they use is entirely renewable. There’s also a crypto mining operation set up at a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania, adjacent to what will be an Amazon Web Services data center.

The main way crypto operations interact with the grid is not by supporting any particular resource, though, but rather by being flexible about when they operate. Shutting off when demand is high can be quite lucrative — sometimes even more so than the crypto mining itself.

Riot Networks, a mining company with extensive operations in Texas and a plaintiff in the EIA record collection suit, has become a flashpoint for crypto’s interaction with the electricity markets precisely because it eagerly shares data with investors and the public about its participation in programs to maintain grid stability. In August, when demand hit record highs and Texas consumers were asked to conserve energy, Riot reported $8.6 million in revenue from selling Bitcoins it had mined and $31.6 million either from selling power it had bought for a prearranged price back to the grid at the higher market price or from incentive payments for being willing to power down during demand spikes.

The company’s chief executive said that last August “was a landmark month for Riot in showcasing the benefits of our unique power strategy.” (Of the 34 large Bitcoin mining operations in the New York Times investigation, Riot was the largest and had the most fossil fuel consumption attributed to it.)

But that was then and this is now. The revenues Riot is deriving from Bitcoin mining are likely substantially greater than they were five or six months ago, as the price of Bitcoin has almost doubled. The company has told investors that it costs around $7,500 to mine a single Bitcoin, which could mean that it and other crypto miners operating strategically in the electricity market will be less willing to sell power back to the grid or turn off during demand spikes.

If you’re thinking this all sounds a lot like the conversation around demand response, well, so was I. Demand response is something climate people love to talk about. They want consumers to get paid for using less power when demand spikes, and they think it’s really neat that you can charge an electric car overnight when demand is low and want you to be able to sell that power back to the grid when demand gets high.

,Shiba Inu Is Up 300% Over the Past Month. Here's Why You Should Buy Bitcoin Instead.,"In the crypto market, the most popular meme coins have skyrocketed in value within a remarkably short period of time. Shiba Inu (CRYPTO: SHIB), for example, is now up more than 300% over the past 30 days.

In a single 24-hour period, it was up more than 45%. Even with these incredible recent gains, Shiba Inu is still trading 50% below its all-time high, leading some investors to think that it could have plenty more room to run.

That might be the case, but I'm still buying Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) instead. Yes, you can argue that Bitcoin is also overheating as it hits a new all-time high, but there are three fundamental factors that make it a much better buy than Shiba Inu.
1. Utility

The starting point for any comparison of Shiba Inu and Bitcoin needs to be utility. The former is a meme coin with no real use. As such, its ability to soar in value is often based on nothing more than hype, speculative buzz, and the desire of many crypto investors to get rich quick.

Would you invest in a company that has no underlying assets and no real strategy for growth? If the answer is no, then Shiba Inu is probably not for you.
In contrast, Bitcoin adoption is growing on a global scale, and new uses are continually emerging. ARK Invest now tracks eight separate use cases.

For example, some investors now refer to Bitcoin as ""digital gold,"" because it can serve the same purposes as physical gold: as a hedge against inflation and a long-term store of value. During economic uncertainty, it can also be a safe-haven asset.
2. Coin supply

To understand the price dynamics of Shiba Inu and Bitcoin, just consider the total circulating supply of both coins. Bitcoin's total lifetime supply is capped at 21 million coins, and 19.7 million of these are already in circulation.

Roughly speaking, nearly all of the Bitcoin that can ever exist already exists. So as demand for Bitcoin grows over time, this relative scarcity is going to exert a significant impact on its future price.

We're already starting to see this with the adoption of the new spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). If you compare the amount of Bitcoin that gets created (i.e. ""mined"") on a single day, and then compare it to the amount of money that is flowing into the new ETFs every day, it's obvious why the price of Bitcoin has been soaring of late.

On any given day, demand for Bitcoin is approximately 10 times higher than the new supply of Bitcoin. We're reaching a point where some are warning that there is simply not enough Bitcoin to go around.

In contrast, the supply of Shiba Inu is nearly unlimited. There are now 589 trillion coins in circulation, making it nearly a mathematical impossibility for the crypto to ever break through the $1 price level. For that to happen, it would need to have an implied market cap of $589 trillion, which is roughly 300 times the market cap of a company like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).

Shiba Inu has initiated a massive coin-burning strategy to reduce supply, but it simply can't burn coins fast enough to make a difference.
3. The role of institutional investors

Lastly, mention needs to be made of the massive Wall Street and institutional investor support behind Bitcoin right now. The approval of the new spot Bitcoin ETFs in January was a watershed moment for the crypto industry.

It shows that the largest asset managers in the world -- such as BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) and Fidelity Investments -- are now behind Bitcoin. Over time, that institutional support will eventually lead to higher portfolio allocations to Bitcoin, helping to push up its price.

That type of institutional investor support simply does not exist for Shiba Inu. It's hard to imagine any responsible investment advisor recommending a portfolio allocation of any significance to meme coins such as Shiba Inu.

That being said, this might be your last chance to turn a profit on any Shiba Inu you are holding from the last crypto bull market rally. A number of leading indicators are now flashing red, suggesting that the current meme coin mega-rally for Shiba Inu might be short-lived at best. As a result, I'm buying Bitcoin and ignoring all the speculative froth with meme coins right now.

,"1 Top Cryptocurrency to Buy Before It Soars 3,353%, According to Cathie Wood","Known for its strict focus on disruptive and innovative technologies, Ark Invest is a firm that has gotten a lot of attention in recent years. The company's founder, Cathie Wood, is widely considered a top investor.

Given its massive potential to change how people store and transfer wealth, it's not surprising that Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is a favorite asset for Wood and her analyst team. The world's most valuable cryptocurrency has made for a fantastic investment, soaring 1,540% in the last five years (as of March 4).

Cathie Wood is extremely optimistic about its future. Her firm thinks that Bitcoin, despite its impressive historical run, can skyrocket by 3,353%, reaching $2.3 million per token.
An extremely bullish outlook

Key to Ark Invest's incredibly bullish outlook is the idea that Bitcoin will find its way into more portfolios, particularly for larger institutional investors. The firm's analysis shows that if 19.4% of the $250 trillion in global investable assets were allocated to Bitcoin, the price of one coin could be a whopping $2.3 million, with the entire network valued at $48.5 trillion.

Even at a 1% allocation, which seems much more reasonable, Bitcoin's price would be $120,000. That's 80% higher than the current price of $66,600.

In its Big Ideas 2024 report, Ark Invest lays out factors that are driving greater Bitcoin adoption, particularly as a means for investors to de-risk their portfolios.

This might sound outrageous to those who still view Bitcoin as a fraud or Ponzi scheme, most notably JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. But it's hard to deny the digital asset's attractive qualities. Bitcoin is fully decentralized, has no counterparty risk, provides portfolio diversification benefits, is extremely liquid, and has a fixed supply cap.

That last point shouldn't be taken lightly. With a potential total of 21 million coins, scarcity is what makes Bitcoin a compelling store of value. Ark Invest believes more people will slowly realize this.
Near-term catalysts

The sentiment surrounding Bitcoin is enthusiastic for many reasons.

The recent introduction of spot exchange-traded funds was a breakthrough moment for Bitcoin, providing an easy and frictionless way to gain exposure to the asset's price. And the upcoming halving, set to cut the rate of new supply in half, has historically been a very bullish event for Bitcoin.

Plus, Ark Invest believes that 2024 will be a big year that will see more asset managers shift their view of Bitcoin, from considering it ""a speculative instrument"" to considering it ""a strategic investment in a diversified portfolio."" Add this to ongoing progress to achieve regulatory clarity, and you have the ingredients for Bitcoin to continue its rise.
Set realistic expectations

However, I urge investors not to get overly attached to the lofty price target of Cathie Wood and Ark Invest. Her firm is known for throwing out wild numbers on forecasts.

To be clear, I don't think anyone knows what Bitcoin's price will be 10 or 20 years from now. If you expect it to reach a market cap of $48.5 trillion, which is Wood's most bullish scenario, then you're banking on a lot of things going right. There's just too much uncertainty for this to happen.

In my opinion, Bitcoin still makes for a smart investment right now, even though its price has surged recently. But it's best to temper expectations, as gains likely aren't going to resemble those of the past.

Set realistic expectations However, I urge investors not to get overly attached to the lofty price target of Cathie Wood and Ark Invest. To be clear, I don't think anyone knows what Bitcoin's price will be 10 or 20 years from now. 5 trillion, which is Wood's most bullish scenario, then you're banking on a lot of things going right.

Tokens such as Dogecoin and Pepe posted double-digit percentage gains on Friday, adding to the eye-popping rallies seen throughout the week. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, is up about 16% so far this week, or more than double its larger peer.

“As Bitcoin consolidates at current levels and ETH relatively outperformed in the short-term, eyes are sure to be focused on altcoins and specific side-narratives that start to spin up,” said Chris Newhouse, a DeFi analyst at Cumberland Labs.

After reaching $70,000 on Friday, Bitcoin quickly pared gains to trade around $68,000. Ether was approaching $4,000 for the first time since December 2021.

“I think $80K by end of month is not crazy,” said Leo Mizuhara, founder and chief executive of decentralized-finance institutional asset management platform Hashnote. “I just think the FOMO players are coming in soon. ETFs have opened up the space to even more retail.”

Ether is benefitting from rising expectations that the token will be the next to win approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission to be offered through exchange-traded funds. Surging demand for the Bitcoin ETFs approved in January have been the main catalyst for this year’s more than 60% rally in the token.

Memecoins have long been a phenomenon among retail crypto investors and promoters, who see the microscopic prices as an opportunity to quickly post huge returns despite the lack of traditional fundamentals. The token Shiba Inu was considered the most popular in the last bull market, while Dogecoin is viewed as the original memecoin by many in the industry. Traders are positioning PEPE, WIF and other newcomers as the next big opportunity.

“As capital continues to be deployed across the private markets, retail has started to notice emerging narratives to take note of when an eventual ‘altcoin season’ emerges off the back of a potential rotation out of ETH and across the broader ecosystem,” Newhouse said.

,"Bitcoin briefly surges past US$70,000","Bitcoin set a new all-time high for the second time this week.

Bitcoin traded above US$70,000 for the first time on Friday before sharply falling, according to CoinMarketCap data.

CoinMarketCap, a cryptocurrency data aggregator that gathers its price data from 723 exchanges, now states that Bitcoin’s all-time price record is US$70,083.

Rival data aggregator CoinGecko, which tracks the price of assets in 980 exchanges, also reported a new trading record for the world’s largest cryptocurrency at US$69,255.

The cryptocurrency has since fallen to around US$67,000, according to both data providers.

Earlier this week, Bitcoin set a new record by briefly surging above US$69,000.

However, similar to Friday’s performance, the cryptocurrency abruptly took a sharp U-turn, shedding nearly 7% of its value.

The recent price movements in Bitcoin are underpinned by a combination of factors, including technological advancements, regulatory shifts, and macroeconomic conditions.

Institutional interest in cryptocurrencies has been solidified by the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S.

The market is also responding to the Federal Reserve’s stance on interest rates, with Chairman Jerome Powell indicating that the central bank is close to having enough confidence in inflation returning to its 2% target to begin reducing rates.

,"Bitcoin briefly rises to record high over $70,000","By Hannah Lang

(Reuters) - Bitcoin briefly rallied to a record high on Friday in volatile trading, as crypto mania continued to sweep through the investment community.

The leading cryptocurrency topped the $70,000 mark for the first time, boosted by investor demand for new U.S. spot exchange-traded crypto products and expectations for global interest rates to fall.

It rose to as high as $70,105 before quickly dropping, and was last trading at $68,317.72.

Billions of dollars have flowed into ETFs in the past few weeks, and the market is getting extra support from an outlook that includes an upgrade to the ethereum blockchain platform, home to the second-largest cryptocurrency ether, and a bitcoin ""halving"" event, which slows the flow of bitcoin minting, in April.

Still, some say it's hard to shake off the speculative nature of these assets. After hitting a record high on Tuesday, bitcoin sharply reversed course and fell more than 10% back below the $60,000 level.

""Navigating old highs is notoriously tricky and the bitcoin dam doesn’t tend to burst at the first time of asking,"" said Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto lending platform Nexo. ""Volatility defines bitcoin bull markets, and 2024 will be littered with sudden and gut-wrenching 10%-20% plunges.""

The approval of 11 spot bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in late January marked a watershed moment for the industry, following an 18-month-long crypto winter plagued by a string of high-profile corporate bankruptcies and scandals.

Even institutional investors, who once shunned crypto due to its sharp, wild moves, have begun committing long-term money, which analysts say could help sustain the latest leg of this rally.

Net flows into the 10 largest U.S. spot bitcoin funds reached $2.2 billion in the week ended March 1, with more than $2 billion of that going into BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, according to LSEG data.

The recent optimism over bitcoin has also spilled over to other digital tokens, particularly ether, which ranks second behind bitcoin in terms of total market value, up more than 60% since the start of the year.

Ether was last up 1.62% at $3,939.84. Crypto stocks were also up on Friday, with shares of Coinbase last higher at 8.2%, and crypto miners Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital up 5.1% and 9.6%, respectively.

,Coinbase Tops Direct Listing Price as Bitcoin Surges to Record,"(Bloomberg) -- Coinbase Global Inc. has finally climbed back above its direct listing price Friday morning for the first time in more than two years.

When the biggest US cryptocurrency exchange went public in a direct listing in 2021, the reference price was set at $250 per share. Though there was early enthusiasm for the stock — shares rallied to an all-time high close of $350 in November 2021 — they ended their first 12 months of trading down 38%.

Coinbase shares remained under pressure for the next few years as a crypto-winter hit digital tokens and trading platforms came under increased scrutiny from the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

In the last year, however, Coinbase has ripped higher lifted by the price of Bitcoin, — which surged to an all-time high Tuesday — and the SEC’s approval of exchange-traded funds that invest directly in the digital asset. Shares of the trading platform are up more than 300% in the last 12 months.

Of course, surpassing the direct listing reference price may not bring much relief to any early investors still holding shares. In its first day of trading in 2021, the stock opened at a price of $381, mostly driven by retail buying, and rallied as much as 13% before falling to end the day lower. Coinbase ended 2022 down 86%.

Still, the stock has been grinding higher along with Bitcoin, the world’s largest crypto based on market value. Even two recent glitches on the platform — within less than a week of each other — which had some individual investors seeing zero balances in their Coinbase accounts hasn’t deterred share growth.

Other crypto-linked stocks have also gotten a lift during the latest jump in Bitcoin’s price. Shares of MicroStrategy Inc., Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. and CleanSpark Inc. are all up on the year, continuing rallies from 2023.

,ETF Spotlight: BlackRock’s IBIT Grabs Crypto Crown,"This week’s Spotlight ETF may eventually turn out to be ETF of the year, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves and for now have a look at the record-setting debut of the iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT).

Launched Jan. 11 along with 10 rival spot bitcoin ETFs, each vying for the eager dollars of investors and financial advisors looking for an easy onramp to cryptocurrency investing, IBIT in short order pulled away from the pack.

While currently up to more than $12 billion in assets under management, IBIT entered March by reaching the $10 billion in assets mark faster than any other ETF in history.

For some perspective, it took the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) more than two years after its 2004 launch to hit $10 billion.

For even more perspective, the next largest spot bitcoin ETF among the 11 launched in January is the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) at $7.6 billion.
The why behind the breakout popularity of IBIT is at least two-fold.

For starters, we’re talking about New York-based BlackRock Inc., which at more than $10 trillion in total assets under management, has the kind of resources to overshadow whatever it wants to overshadow in the financial services industry.

BlackRock’s iShares ETF brand manages $2.7 trillion.

Compare that to Boston-based Fidelity Investments, which is no slouch at $3 trillion in total assets, including nearly $700 billion in ETF assets, but still a third the size of BlackRock.

“When you see stuff fly out the door, that’s where your attention goes,” said Mark Connors, head of research at the Canadian digital asset management firm 3iQ.

“Right now, the BlackRock sales force is no longer talking about ESG or bonds,” he added. “They’re looking at IBIT.”

The second part of the two-fold growth spurt of IBIT is the rallying price of the underlying bitcoin, which touched an all-time high earlier this week and is up more than 55% over the past 30 days.

Granted, the bitcoin rally is lifting all spot bitcoin ETFs, but when price appreciation accounts for about 40% of the asset growth in those ETFs, bigger just gets bigger.

,Binance must face revived investor lawsuit in US over crypto losses,"By Jonathan Stempel

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A federal appeals court on Friday revived a lawsuit where investors accused Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, of violating U.S. securities laws by selling unregistered tokens that lost much of their value.

In a 3-0 decision, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said investors in the proposed class action plausibly alleged that domestic securities laws applied because their purchases of tokens had become irrevocable in the United States once they paid for them.

Circuit Judge Alison Nathan said Binance's use of domestic Amazon computer servers to host its platform supported this outcome, given how Binance ""notoriously denies the applicability of any other country's securities regulation regime.""

The appeals court also said investors could pursue claims arising from purchases made within the year before they sued.

Friday's decision reversed a March 2022 ruling by U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter in Manhattan, and returned the case to him.

The appeal covered investors who had bought seven tokens - ELF, EOS, FUN, ICX, OMG, QSP and TRX - through Binance starting in 2017, and which soon lost much of their value.

They claimed that Binance failed to warn them about the tokens' ""significant risks"" and sought to recoup what they paid.

Binance argued that U.S. securities laws did not apply because its exchange was located outside the country.

It cited 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Morrison v National Australia Bank, that limited the extraterritorial reach of domestic securities laws.

Binance and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Jordan Goldstein, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said his clients were pleased that the court ""unanimously acknowledged the strength of our claims.""

The case is separate from Binance's recent guilty plea and more than $4.3 billion penalty for violating federal anti-money laundering and sanctions laws.

Binance founder Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to related money laundering violations and stepped down as chief executive. His sentencing is scheduled for April 30.

The case is Lee et al v Binance et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 22-972.

In a 3-0 decision, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said investors in the proposed class action plausibly alleged that domestic securities laws applied because their purchases of tokens had become irrevocable in the United States once they paid for them.

Circuit Judge Alison Nathan said Binance's use of domestic Amazon computer servers to host its platform supported this outcome, given how Binance ""notoriously denies the applicability of any other country's securities regulation regime.""

The appeals court also said investors could pursue claims arising from purchases made within the year before they sued.

Friday's decision reversed a March 2022 ruling by U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter in Manhattan, and returned the case to him.

The appeal covered investors who had bought seven tokens - ELF, EOS, FUN, ICX, OMG, QSP and TRX - through Binance starting in 2017, and which soon lost much of their value.

They claimed that Binance failed to warn them about the tokens' ""significant risks"" and sought to recoup what they paid.

Binance argued that U.S. securities laws did not apply because its exchange was located outside the country.

It cited 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Morrison v National Australia Bank, that limited the extraterritorial reach of domestic securities laws.

Binance and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Jordan Goldstein, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said his clients were pleased that the court ""unanimously acknowledged the strength of our claims.""

The case is separate from Binance's recent guilty plea and more than $4.3 billion penalty for violating federal anti-money laundering and sanctions laws.

Binance founder Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to related money laundering violations and stepped down as chief executive. His sentencing is scheduled for April 30.

The case is Lee et al v Binance et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 22-972.

(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York, Editing by Franklin Paul)","A US court revived a lawsuit accusing Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange, of violating investor rights. 3 judges in a unanimous decision in the 2nd U.

,Bitcoin Ordinals Runestone Up For Auction Ahead of Airdrop,"The Runestone, a landmark inscription on the Bitcoin blockchain notable for its size, is up for auction. Leonidas emphasizes the project's commitment to fair distribution: ""There is no team allocation, pre-sale, etc., and the open-source eligibility algorithm was designed to not favor whales."" He positions the Runestone as ""a non-utility project"" and collectible art, viewing it as a ""badge of honor"" for those who believed in the Ordinal protocol early on.

The inscription currently holds the record for the largest ordinal by block size. Bidding for the Runestone, designated as inscription 63,140,674, currently sits at 0.26 BTC, roughly equivalent to $17,261.61 on the Ord City marketplace. Importantly, all proceeds from the auction will be directed towards covering network fees associated with the upcoming Runestone airdrop and distributed to Bitcoin miners. The Runestone auction concludes on March 8, 2024, at noon EST.

This auction follows the highly anticipated Runestone airdrop, officially inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain earlier this week. This 3.97 MB inscription, encompassing two entire blocks, is one of only seven ordinals exceeding 400,000 bytes. Notably, it was created in collaboration with OrdinalsBot and Marathon Digital Holdings, who mined the record-breaking 3,991,547-byte block for its inscription.

While the exact date remains undisclosed, the upcoming Runestone airdrop will see over 112,000 eligible Bitcoin addresses receive a Runestone inscription. Additionally, a future airdrop of Runes tokens is planned upon the launch of the Runes protocol on the Bitcoin network, expected to coincide with the Bitcoin halving around April 20, 2024.","The Runestone, a landmark inscription on the Bitcoin blockchain notable for its size, is up for auction.

,"Bitcoin Record High Would’ve Happened Without ETFs, Just Later, Say Experts","    Bitcoin's latest all-time high on Tuesday morning was accelerated by the launch of the spot bitcoin ETFs, experts said.

    The cryptocurrency started its rally in earnest in the fall of 2023 as it became clearer that the funds would soon be approved.

    Experts said that it would've reached a new all-time high nevertheless, but the ETFs have been an important tailwind.

Bitcoin {{BTC}} reached a highly anticipated new all-time high above $69,000 on Tuesday only two months after the approval and launch of the ten spot bitcoin ETFs. The fast timeline has left people wondering: would the new high have happened so soon if the ETFs hadn’t launched?

No, according to Seth Ginns, managing partner and head of liquid investments at CoinFund. “The new all-time high would have happened without the ETFs, but we’ve likely accelerated this cycle with the ETF flows,” he said.

Even with Grayscale's GBTC losing more than 200,000 from its bitcoin holdings since the ETF launches in January, the spot funds on a net basis have accumulated just shy of 163,000 tokens, according to data from BitMEX. BlackRock's IBIT and Fidelity's FBTC alone hold more than 196,000 bitcoins.

“I definitely think the introduction of the ETF was a significant tailwind and, without it, we wouldn’t be at all time highs,” said Jim Iuorio, managing director of TJM Institutional Services and a veteran futures and options trader.

Iuorio believes that the recent rally is not just ETF-driven, but rooted just as much in the current political landscape, including anticipation that the U.S. Federal Reserve’s will lower benchmark interest rates in the coming months, as well as the end of the Bank Term Funding Program – an emergency platform put in place by the Fed in 2023 to stem what threatened to turn into a banking crisis.

“The bid in all of crypto is a “no confidence” vote for the stewardship of fiat currencies and the potential for the Fed to restart quantitative easing and accommodative policy to assist in a pinch,” said Iuorio.

In addition to the roughly 50% rally in bitcoin since the ETFs came online in January, much of the token's near-tripling in price in 2023 came after BlackRock in June indicated its intention to open a spot fund and Grayscale was victorious in its court case challenging the SEC's rejection of its spot ETF hopes.

“While there are likely multiple factors driving the price of bitcoin right now, there is no question ETFs are playing a starring role,” said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store. “The convenience of the ETF wrapper has unlocked a significant new source of demand in the form of retail investors, advisors, and institutional investors who didn’t want to hassle with buying bitcoin directly from crypto exchanges.”","    Bitcoin's latest all-time high on Tuesday morning was accelerated by the launch of the spot bitcoin ETFs, experts said.

,ETFs Fueling Fire of Bitcoin Rally,"This article was originally published on ETFTrends.com.

Tuesday was an action-packed day for bitcoin. The largest digital currency by market capitalization ascended to a new all-time high. It extended its 2024 gain to over 63%. And then it almost immediately succumbed to a breathtaking decline of 14%.

Some of those losses were recouped, and while it is clear that the crypto's volatility is creeping higher as the digital currency does the same, the bullish trend remains intact. Some of that is attributable to the spot bitcoin exchange traded funds that debuted last month.

Broadly speaking, those products are proving to be hits among market participants and acting as new, significant buyers of the digital currency in the process. And recent data indicates these rookie ETFs are buying more of the crypto on a daily basis than is being mined.
Spot ETFs Boon for the Cryptocurrency

Longtime followers of the cryptocurrency space know it took years for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve spot ETFs. At times, the commission appeared overtly hostile toward these efforts and crypto in general. That perspective changed, and prices for the digital currency have benefited as a result.

“The move has widened the mass-market accessibility of Bitcoin, helping the crypto sector to turn the page following a bear market in 2022 and a string of subsequent bankruptcies, including the implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange,” reported Phillip Lagerkranser for Bloomberg.

While likely just a coincidence, the January debut of the spot bitcoin ETFs occurred just three months of the quadrennial halving. That means that two supply-reducing dynamics are at play for the cryptocurrency at the same time. Given the digital asset's 2024 price action, it’s clear it’s benefiting from those scenarios.
Impending Reduction in Supply Growth

“A steady tide of money has poured into the ETFs issued by investment heavyweights including BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments. The net inflow of almost $8 billion in less than two months is colliding with a looming reduction in Bitcoin’s supply growth — known as the halving — that is also stoking bullish sentiment,” according to Bloomberg.

These spot ETFs trading in the U.S. include the VanEck Bitcoin ETF Trust (HODL), Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO), WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), and the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB).

Beyond providing a boost to bitcoin prices, those ETFs are serving other important functions. Notably, these spot ETFs have brought more institutions into the cryptomarket, which some experts believe could be a longer-ranging theme. Additionally, the ETFs are broadening the audience for digital assets among advisors and previously apprehensive retail investors.

,My Mom Texted Me’: Bitcoin’s Comeback Energizes Long-Time Proponents,"(Bloomberg) -- From Wall Street to main street, the sudden comeback of Bitcoin is energizing investors big and small.

Bitcoin briefly topped $69,000 on Tuesday, surpassing the all-time peak it achieved in late 2021. The biggest digital currency is back in the spotlight with the crypto industry persevering through two years of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and criminal scandals.

For Anthony Scaramucci, this moment is not yet time to celebrate. The SkyBridge Capital founder said he was at a Starbucks drinking coffee Tuesday morning when he got the notification on Bitcoin breaking the previous all-time-high.

“I’ve been humbled by life. I’ve been humbled by markets,” he said. “The industry is back. I don’t think it’s going to be a straight line up.”

It’s a stark contrast from more than a year ago, when crypto exchange FTX collapsed and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried, a one-time business partner of Scaramucci, faced criminal charges.

“If you were sitting with me in February 2023, I needed oxygen. I was on the ground. The company was getting hit - the problem with FTX. I had a very large position of Bitcoin that was getting crushed, and I was literally having the worst year of my career,” Scaramucci recounted the episode to Bloomberg in an interview in February.

Still, Skybridge held onto to its Bitcoin holdings, as well as Ether and Solana. Bitcoin rose about 4.6% to $66,249 on Wednesday.

Other crypto hedge funds that suffered from FTX’s failure are also making a comeback. Greg Moritz, co-founder and chief operating officer at Alt Tab Capital, said it was “a moment of joy” when Bitcoin hit its all-time high Tuesday.

Alt Tab had 2% of its assets stuck on FTX. But betting on a confluence of factors that’d boost crypto price, Moritz started to increase the fund’s Bitcoin and altcoin positions since about four months ago.

“It absolutely required a lot of patience,” he said from his home office in Atlanta. “Even in the most depressing days of the bear market, the best you could do is to safeguard your capital as best as you can and then go and have a stiff drink and realize it will be better in a month or a year.”

The breakout of Bitcoin this year also drew renewed interests from mom-and-pop investors.

“I’m just happy to see my Telegram chats lighting up, my friends sending me texts asking what to buy again, and my mom texting me to ask if Bitcoin is doing well because she saw it on TV,” said Chris Newhouse, an Atlanta-based DeFi analyst at Cumberland Labs.

Jakob Paulsen, a 27-year-old investor in Amsterdam who first got into crypto in 2019, said he would still like to buy more Bitcoin. “I feel kinda bummed out,” he said. “When a price rises, it’s nice to see the portfolio grow, but it’s sad to know that you probably might not be able to buy as much for cheaper prices.”

Matthias Barva, a retail crypto investor based in Norway, expects to see a “correction, and another correction” of the Bitcoin price. “There will be some euphoria in the market, but this is really not what we are waiting for,” Barva said. He hopes ultimately that the Bitcoin ecosystem will grow and there will be more adoptions of non-centralized wallets around the world.

Michael Terpin, a crypto investor since 2013 who bought his first Bitcoin when it was $120, said he’s holding onto his tokens, in anticipation of what he called a “potential super cycle,” in part driven by an upcoming reduction in Bitcoin’s supply growth known as the halving that is adding to the renewed optimism.

He’s ready for celebrations at an event later Tuesday in Los Angeles. “I open a bottle of champagne at every halving and every all-time high,” he said.

It’s a stark contrast from more than a year ago, when crypto exchange FTX collapsed and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried, a one-time business partner of Scaramucci, faced criminal charges.

“If you were sitting with me in February 2023, I needed oxygen. I was on the ground. The company was getting hit - the problem with FTX. I had a very large position of Bitcoin that was getting crushed, and I was literally having the worst year of my career,” Scaramucci recounted the episode to Bloomberg in an interview in February.

Still, Skybridge held onto to its Bitcoin holdings, as well as Ether and Solana. Bitcoin rose about 4.6% to $66,249 on Wednesday.

Other crypto hedge funds that suffered from FTX’s failure are also making a comeback. Greg Moritz, co-founder and chief operating officer at Alt Tab Capital, said it was “a moment of joy” when Bitcoin hit its all-time high Tuesday.

Alt Tab had 2% of its assets stuck on FTX. But betting on a confluence of factors that’d boost crypto price, Moritz started to increase the fund’s Bitcoin and altcoin positions since about four months ago.

“It absolutely required a lot of patience,” he said from his home office in Atlanta. “Even in the most depressing days of the bear market, the best you could do is to safeguard your capital as best as you can and then go and have a stiff drink and realize it will be better in a month or a year.”

The breakout of Bitcoin this year also drew renewed interests from mom-and-pop investors.

“I’m just happy to see my Telegram chats lighting up, my friends sending me texts asking what to buy again, and my mom texting me to ask if Bitcoin is doing well because she saw it on TV,” said Chris Newhouse, an Atlanta-based DeFi analyst at Cumberland Labs.

Jakob Paulsen, a 27-year-old investor in Amsterdam who first got into crypto in 2019, said he would still like to buy more Bitcoin. “I feel kinda bummed out,” he said. “When a price rises, it’s nice to see the portfolio grow, but it’s sad to know that you probably might not be able to buy as much for cheaper prices.”

Matthias Barva, a retail crypto investor based in Norway, expects to see a “correction, and another correction” of the Bitcoin price. “There will be some euphoria in the market, but this is really not what we are waiting for,” Barva said. He hopes ultimately that the Bitcoin ecosystem will grow and there will be more adoptions of non-centralized wallets around the world.

Michael Terpin, a crypto investor since 2013 who bought his first Bitcoin when it was $120, said he’s holding onto his tokens, in anticipation of what he called a “potential super cycle,” in part driven by an upcoming reduction in Bitcoin’s supply growth known as the halving that is adding to the renewed optimism.

He’s ready for celebrations at an event later Tuesday in Los Angeles. “I open a bottle of champagne at every halving and every all-time high,” he said.

,"Bitcoin Has Been a Better Investment Over the Past 5 Years Than All but 1 of the ""Magnificient Seven"" Stocks","The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks have garnered a lot of attention over the past year as investors have become captivated with tech and growth stocks again. And there's good reason to be excited because these stocks make up the best and brightest of the market.

They also stand to benefit significantly from the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI). The Magnificent Seven are Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla.

But as great as those tech stocks have been over the years, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) has still largely been the better investment over the past five years. During that time frame, it has generated impressive returns of more than 1,500%. And only one of the Magnificent Seven stocks has performed better over that stretch.
Bitcoin has been a better buy than six of the Magnificent Seven

The only one of the Magnificent Seven stocks that has outperformed Bitcoin in the past five years has been Nvidia, which is a name that has become synonymous with the boom in AI. The chipmaker is at the forefront of AI-related growth with its data centers and AI chips playing a pivotal role in the transformation of many businesses seeking to take advantage of the latest trends in tech.

But compared to all the other Magnificent Seven stocks, Bitcoin has easily outperformed them by a wide margin.
Why has Bitcoin been such a hot investment?

A big reason Bitcoin has done so well is that its starting point five years ago was relatively low. At the start of March 2019, it was trading at less than $4,000. Yesterday, it reached a new record -- $69,171.

Five years ago, the digital currency was coming off a big crash in 2018, and it wouldn't be until the meme hype of 2020 and 2021 where its valuation would take off again. Investing in an asset at a depressed valuation can give investors more potential upside in the long run. The trade-off is that there's normally a great deal of risk involved, since that's the reason it's trading at a low price to begin with.

But with investors growing more optimistic about the future of cryptocurrency, and some investors even treating it as a haven type of asset (as ""digital gold""), its price has soared. And the anticipation and eventual launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds generated even more bullishness in crypto during the past year.

Five years ago, most of the Magnificent Seven stocks had market caps in excess of $100 billion. The two exceptions were Tesla and Nvidia, which have also been the best-performing stocks of the group since then.
Is Bitcoin still a good investment today?

The challenge with investing in Bitcoin is that it's a highly speculative investment and it's hard to gauge what its valuation will be in a year or two. There are plenty of optimists who believe it can go to $1 million, but there's also the possibility that regulators impose restrictions that inhibit its growth prospects and lead to a more depressed valuation.

Given the volatility surrounding crypto, it's not an investment I would feel comfortable holding. And unless you are willing to accept the high risk that comes with it as an investment and the possibility that you could lose all or most of your money, then you're still better off avoiding it.

Although there are catalysts, such as Bitcoin halving, which could drive the value of the digital coin higher this year, investors should be careful not to get caught up in the hype as the cryptocurrency has crashed before, and it could crash again.

,Crypto’s $800 Billion Rally Widens Beyond Record-Setting Bitcoin,"(Bloomberg) -- Smaller cryptocurrencies are starting to pull ahead of record-setting Bitcoin as traders bet the tokens are next in line to test all-time peaks.

An index tracking the bottom half of the largest 100 digital assets is up about 60% over the past month, beating the 56% advance in Bitcoin. During the same period, the overall value of tokens jumped by more than $800 billion, according to data tracker CoinGecko

Market observers contend there are growing such signs of speculators rotating away from the largest digital asset into smaller rivals that have lagged in the Bitcoin-led crypto recovery that began last year.

“Our desk has been seeing strong flows and more excitement on non-Bitcoin assets recently,” said David Lawant, head of research at crypto prime broker FalconX. At one point five times as much investment was flowing into Bitcoin compared with second-ranked Ether but that has dropped to two times, he said.

Bitcoin Dominance

Coins like Ether remain some way off hitting all-time highs, a reflection of the intense focus on Bitcoin amid the launch of landmark US exchange-traded funds for the token as well as an upcoming reduction in its supply growth.

“Bitcoin’s market dominance typically tops out in the weeks following an all-time high breakout,” Vetle Lunde, a senior analyst at K33 Research, wrote in a note. He added that ramped-up bets on altcoins are a typical feature of an “all gas, no brakes stage of the market.”

Frothy wagers on Bitcoin have washed across the derivatives sector, evidenced by metrics such as elevated costs for perpetual futures and unprecedented levels of open interest — or outstanding contracts — at Chicago-based CME Group’s Bitcoin futures market.

Futures Appetite

That too is a positive backdrop for smaller digital assets, according to Jag Kooner, head of derivatives at crypto exchange Bitfinex.

“It’s anticipated that the surge in open interest will eventually redistribute toward altcoins as the market’s focus shifts away from Bitcoin, further out on the risk curve toward meme tokens, which accounted for a third of the volume on major exchanges last week,” Kooner wrote in a note.

Meme coins Shiba Inu, Floki, dogwifhat, Pepe and Bonk sat atop the seven-day performance charts at CoinGecko, with gains of about 150% or more as of 9:20 a.m. Wednesday in London. Bitcoin changed hands at $67,250, a little shy of the record $69,192 reached on Tuesday in US trading.

While crypto veterans might rationalize the meme trend as part of the pivot beyond Bitcoin, others could well see it as mindless speculation.

,"Cryptocurrencies Are Soaring: Will Bitcoin Hit $100,000 This Year?","Since the start of 2024, the cryptocurrency asset class has jumped more than 35%, hitting a total valuation of more than $2.25 trillion. These levels haven't been seen since November 2021, making it safe to say that crypto is back.

At the forefront of crypto's resurgence is Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC). In just 2024 alone, it's added $400 billion to its market and finds itself a measly 10% off of its all-time high of around $68,000.

For years, investors have had their sights set on Bitcoin reaching a $100,000 price tag, and it finally looks like it could happen. As Bitcoin's price is pushed and pulled by supply and demand dynamics, a six-figure Bitcoin isn't a matter of ""if"" but rather, ""when.""

Bitcoin's new customers can't stop buying

At the center of Bitcoin's recent jump is the simple fact that demand has outpaced supply. This struggle between opposing forces is nothing new for Bitcoin, but the scale and magnitude at which this is occurring might be.

With the launch of 11 new Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Wall Street juggernauts such as BlackRock and Fidelity have embarked on a historic accumulation to meet investor demand. To back their ETFs, these companies collectively own more than 775,000 coins, representing more than 4% of Bitcoin's total supply.

With this massive buying spree, a supply crunch is forming. Around 900 Bitcoins are created each day. With these ETFs accumulating roughly 10,000 per day, demand is around 10 times greater than the rate of supply. On Feb. 28 alone, more than 11,211 bitcoins were scooped up off the market by ETF sponsors.
A halving unlike any other

It remains to be seen whether these institutions will maintain their rate of accumulation, but what is more certain is that Bitcoin's supply is going to come under even greater pressure in just a few short months. About every four years, Bitcoin's inflation rate is cut in half. Known as the halving, this process is hardwired into Bitcoin's code and serves as the foundation of its robust monetary policy to ensure there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins.

On average, Bitcoin's price rises by 125% in the year a halving occurs. This is likely because buyers are forced to compete for its reduced supply rate. When halvings occur, prices still rise, even if demand remains constant.

If this halving produces an outcome like past ones, Bitcoin could see its price reach somewhere around $99,000 by year-end -- not that far off from the coveted six-figure price. However, when digging a little deeper into the current dynamics of Bitcoin's supply, it becomes apparent that this halving is shaping up to be unlike any other in its 15-year history and could provide the extra fuel needed to reach $100,000.

While around 19.6 million bitcoins are technically in circulation today, only 2.2 million are readily available for purchase on exchanges. This is the lowest level seen since early 2018. More importantly, such low levels mean that the upcoming halving will be the first time in Bitcoin's history that there are fewer coins on the market than at the time of the previous halving.
The perfect recipe for $100,000

Let's add it all up. We have institutions buying at unprecedented rates, there's a halving coming up in less than two months that will push Bitcoin's inflation rate to under 1%, and there's an existing supply that's already under immense pressure.

Nothing is certain, especially in crypto, but it's difficult to see how these developments won't compound and send Bitcoin to not only new all-time highs, but also past the long sought-after $100,000 mark. While it would have been nice to be buying when Bitcoin was trading around $45,000 at the beginning of the year, there's still plenty of evidence that suggests Bitcoin will be a valuable investment, even buying in at today's prices.

If this halving produces an outcome like past ones, Bitcoin could see its price reach somewhere around $99,000 by year-end -- not that far off from the coveted six-figure price. However, when digging a little deeper into the current dynamics of Bitcoin's supply, it becomes apparent that this halving is shaping up to be unlike any other in its 15-year history and could provide the extra fuel needed to reach $100,000.

While around 19.6 million bitcoins are technically in circulation today, only 2.2 million are readily available for purchase on exchanges. This is the lowest level seen since early 2018. More importantly, such low levels mean that the upcoming halving will be the first time in Bitcoin's history that there are fewer coins on the market than at the time of the previous halving.
The perfect recipe for $100,000

Let's add it all up. We have institutions buying at unprecedented rates, there's a halving coming up in less than two months that will push Bitcoin's inflation rate to under 1%, and there's an existing supply that's already under immense pressure.

Nothing is certain, especially in crypto, but it's difficult to see how these developments won't compound and send Bitcoin to not only new all-time highs, but also past the long sought-after $100,000 mark. While it would have been nice to be buying when Bitcoin was trading around $45,000 at the beginning of the year, there's still plenty of evidence that suggests Bitcoin will be a valuable investment, even buying in at today's prices.

Cryptocurrencies Are Soaring: Will Bitcoin Hit $100,000 This Year? was originally published by The Motley Fool","For years, investors have had their sights set on Bitcoin reaching a $100,000 price tag, and it finally looks like it could happen. As Bitcoin's price is pushed and pulled by supply and demand dynamics, a six-figure Bitcoin isn't a matter of ‘‘if‘‘ but rather, ‘‘when. ‘‘ Bitcoin's new customers can't stop buying At the center of Bitcoin's recent jump is the simple fact that demand has outpaced supply. With the launch of 11 new Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Wall Street juggernauts such as BlackRock and Fidelity have embarked on a historic accumulation to meet investor demand. To back their ETFs, these companies collectively own more than 775,000 coins, representing more than 4% of Bitcoin's total supply. With these ETFs accumulating roughly 10,000 per day, demand is around 10 times greater than the rate of supply. A halving unlike any other It remains to be seen whether these institutions will maintain their rate of accumulation, but what is more certain is that Bitcoin's supply is going to come under even greater pressure in just a few short months. About every four years, Bitcoin's inflation rate is cut in half. Known as the halving, this process is hardwired into Bitcoin's code and serves as the foundation of its robust monetary policy to ensure there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins. On average, Bitcoin's price rises by 125% in the year a halving occurs. This is likely because buyers are forced to compete for its reduced supply rate.

,Bitcoin Rebounds as $150K Target for 2024 Comes in View,"    The selling pressure was likely driven by profit-taking and miners offloading some bitcoin holdings.

    Solana’s SOL, Cardano’s ADA, ether and meme coins, started to reverse some of Tuesday’s losses.

Buying demand and a reset in funding rates for perpetuals has buoyed bitcoin {{BTC}} prices early Wednesday, fueling a broader-market recovery.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency tumbled over 7% on Tuesday after briefly touching all-time highs, causing a market-wide sell-off and more than $1 billion in liquidations amid the volatility. It dropped to as low as $60,800 but neared $67,000 in Asian morning hours – indicating resilience.

Some observers said the selling pressure was likely driven by profit-taking at historical highs and miners offloading some of their bitcoin holdings. Data shows that inflows in spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) remained strong, with BlackRock amassing over $760 million on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, some market analysts said lofty price targets for bitcoin remained in view as April’s anticipated halving event, which reduces mining rewards in half, approaches.

“As demand from bitcoin ETFs, with $500 million in daily average inflows, continues to outstrip new production, we may see bitcoin’s ongoing surge continue,” Alex Adelman, CEO of bitcoin rewards application Lolli, shared in an email.

“Following the Halving, increased scarcity and strong demand from retail and institutional investors will likely push bitcoin’s price even higher. Based on historical trends following the Halving, bitcoin’s price could top $150,000 in the next year.”

Some developers say Bitcoin fundamentals are stronger this cycle compared to the previous ones, pointing to the introduction of Ordinals technology and their adoption.

""New innovations such as Ordinals, digital collectibles (NFTs) that are inscribed in the Bitcoin blockchain have driven $3.6 billion in BTC payments over the last 6 months alone,"" shared Stijn Paumen, founder of crypto payments firm Helio, in a message to CoinDesk. ""If this trajectory continues we'll see global adoption of crypto as a mainstream method of a payment in the coming 4-year BTC cycle.""

Major tokens, such as Solana’s SOL, Cardano’s ADA, ether {{ETH}} and meme coins, started to reverse Tuesday’s losses, rising as much as 5% in the past hour on bitcoin’s strength.

,Crypto Funding Rates Reset After Bitcoin's Sharp Pullback From $69K,"    Bitcoin’s overnight pullback from record highs has normalized funding rates in the crypto perpetual futures market.

    The market could continue to cool in the coming weeks, one observer said.

Bitcoin’s {{BTC}} overnight pullback from new record highs has cleared out excess leverage from the market, normalizing funding rates in the crypto perpetual futures market.

The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell 10% to $59,700 after reaching a new lifetime high above $69,000. The correction led to the forced closure of $1 billion worth of leveraged perpetual futures bets across digital asset markets.

The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a broader market gauge, rose to a high of $2,627 on Tuesday and has since pulled back to $2,496.

Since then, the annualized funding rates or the cost of holding leveraged bets in perpetual futures tied to the top 25 cryptocurrencies have reset to less than 20%, down significantly from triple-digit figures observed a few days ago.

In other words, the overheated perpetual futures market has cooled, opening doors for a more long-lasting move to record highs. Funding rates surged above 100% early this week as bitcoin’s strong bullish momentum saw investors jump in with both feet, using leveraged products to maximize gains.

Exchanges use the funding rate mechanism to keep perpetuals prices aligned with spot prices. A positive funding rate indicates that perpetuals are trading at a premium to the spot price, indicating increased demand for bullish bets. As such, a high funding rate, as seen early this week, is said to reflect over-optimism, often observed at interim market tops.

The chart by Velo Data shows funding rates for the top 25 cryptocurrencies have ranged from mildly positive to as high as 150% or more over the past week.

The latest reading for most coins is below 20%.

According to John Glover, chief investment officer at Ledn, the market could continue to deleverage in the coming weeks., potentially pushing bitcoin’s price back to $40,000.

“The euphoria surrounding the recent rally in BTC prices is very reminiscent of the last time we were trading at $65k. While many people will point to the fact that the sell-off that ensued post-November 2021 (and previously after April 2021) was due to bad players in the market, I would argue that, while it may have been precipitated by the bad players, the sell-off was due to people being over-leveraged with unrealistic expectations for a straight-line appreciation to $100,000,” Glover said in an email.

“I believe that we are back in that same situation and we will see a correction back to the mid-to-low $40,000 area in the coming weeks. Things always look bullish at the peak,” Glover added.","    Bitcoin’s overnight pullback from record highs has normalized funding rates in the crypto perpetual futures market.

,Bitcoin Touches All-Time-High Briefly Then Crashes 12%,"Bitcoin experienced a rollercoaster ride on Tuesday, reaching a new all-time high of $69,170 before plummeting 12% within five hours. This volatility comes amidst a weeks-long surge fueled by the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January.

While the price drop was dramatic, analysts argue that it's typical behavior during bull markets. Historical data shows that Bitcoin's previous climbs to all-time highs were characterized by similar periods of significant corrections.

In 2017, Bitcoin experienced eight drops of 25% or more on its path to an all-time high. Meanwhile, in the first half of 2021, during the post-pandemic surge, similar patterns emerged, with 13 corrections of 10% or more.

This historical context puts the recent volatility in perspective, suggesting that it may not be a cause for alarm but rather a characteristic feature of bull markets. Whether this latest dip precedes further consolidation or another leg up remains to be seen, but the historical trend suggests that volatility will likely continue to be a prominent feature in the near future.","Bitcoin experienced a rollercoaster ride on Tuesday, reaching a new all-time high of $69,170 before plummeting 12% within five hours.

,Bitcoin's Test of All-Time Highs Means Old Miners Are Cashing Out,"    Miners appear to have just sold long-dormant bitcoin, sourced from old block rewards, right when BTC plunged from its record high on Tuesday.

    Given the market's thin liquidity, it could have had an outsized impact on bitcoin's price.

Bitcoin's rapid price ascent during the last month, which culminated in a new all-time high and quick reversal on Tuesday, has meant that some early miners have started selling their old block rewards – putting pressure on bitcoin's price.

On-chain data spotted by CryptoQuant shows that, just before bitcoin peaked at new highs around $69,000 and then plunged to $62,000 on Tuesday, 1,000 bitcoin worth roughly $69 million were moved to Coinbase by addresses more than a decade old and that the research firm says are linked to miners. (Shifting long-dormant tokens to Coinbase, a large crypto exchange, can be a prelude to selling.)

""Considering that the exchange order book shows 5-10 bitcoins of liquidity for every $100 price change, a sell-off of 1,000 bitcoins is highly likely to trigger a significant price drop,"" Bradley Park, an analyst at CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk in an interview. ""Especially when traders are waiting to enter a short against bitcoin's all-time high like on Tuesday.""

Park said that the recent influx of bitcoin into exchanges reminds him of the sharp increase in BTC inflows that occurred before the 40% price drop on March 12, 2020, as Covid-19 began to rapidly escalate in severity, causing governments around the world to begin lockdowns, forcing a flight to safety for traders.

When that sell-off finally ended, bitcoin had bottomed out at $3,850.

,"Cathie Wood sells almost 135,000 shares of a top crypto stock","Every era has its famed money managers, and one for this era is Cathie Wood, chief executive of Ark Investment Management.

Known to her devotees as Mama Cathie, Wood’s reputation soared after a stupendous return of 153% in 2020 and clear presentations of her investment philosophy in ubiquitous media appearances.

But her longer-term performance is nothing to brag about. Wood’s flagship Ark Innovation ETF  (ARKK) , with $8.1 billion in assets, has generated a return of 25% for the past 12 months.

That lags the 40% return of the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index. Ark funds holdings are virtually all tech stocks.

Ark Innovation’s annualized return is negative 24% for the past three years and a mere positive 3% for five years.

That compares unfavorably with positive 9% and positive 17% for the Nasdaq during those periods. Wood’s goal is for at least 15% annual returns over five-year stretches.

Cathie Wood’s Market Philosophy

Wood’s investment strategy isn’t hard to fathom. Ark’s ETFs generally buy young, small-company stocks in the high-tech categories of artificial intelligence, blockchain, DNA sequencing, energy storage, and robotics. She views those areas as game changers for the global economy.

Related: Cathie Wood’s Ark is suffering from a discouraging trend

These stocks are quite volatile, of course, so the Ark funds are subject to rollercoaster rides. And Wood frequently trades in and out of her top names.

Investment research titan Morningstar is quite critical of Wood and Ark Innovation ETF. “ARK Innovation has dubious ability to successfully navigate the challenging territory it explores,” Morningstar analyst Robby Greengold wrote last year.

The potential of Wood’s five high-tech platforms listed above is “compelling,” he said. “But Ark’s ability to spot the winners among them and navigate their myriad risks is less so. The strategy’s booms and busts have culminated in middling total returns and extreme volatility since its 2014 inception.”

It’s not an investment 101 portfolio. “The strategy narrowly invests in stocks with paltry current earnings, elevated valuations, and highly correlated stock prices,” Greengold said. “Their extreme volatility underscores their highly uncertain futures.”

Wood has defended herself from Morningstar’s criticism. “I do know there are companies like that one [Morningstar] that do not understand what we're doing,” she told Magnifi Media by Tifin in 2022.

“We do not fit into their style boxes. And I think style boxes will become a thing of the past, as technology blurs the lines between and among sectors.”

But some of Wood’s customers apparently agree with Morningstar. During Ark Innovation’s rally of the past 12 months, it saw a net investment outflow of $1.3 billion.
Cathie Wood's latest trades

On Monday, Wood traded three stocks that she rarely touches. Ark Fintech Innovation ETF  (ARKF)  purchased 12,498 shares of social-media goliath Meta Platforms  (META) , valued at $6.2 million as of Monday’s close.

Fund manager buys and sells:

    Warren Buffett just sold shares of this popular streaming stock

    Paul Tudor Jones’ hedge fund just made a big bet on Nvidia stock

    Stanley Druckenmiller just sold two AI tech stocks

It’s hard to argue that Wood got a bargain, given the stock’s 167% surge over the past 12 months. But artificial intelligence mania could easily push it still higher.

Ark Genomic Revolution ETF  (ARKG)  snagged 10,981 shares of biotechnology stalwart Amgen  (AMGN) , valued at $3.1 million as of Monday’s close. Amgen stock has dropped 15% since hitting a record Feb. 1, pressured by a disappointing earnings report.

So perhaps Wood picked up a bargain. The stock has climbed 18% over the past 12 months.

Meanwhile, Ark Genomic dumped 84,636 shares of pharmaceutical giant Pfizer  (PFE) , valued at $2.2 million. How Pfizer fits into Wood’s investment philosophy is unclear. But the fund has only 35,282 shares left. The stock has tumbled 36% over the past year.

Also on the selling side, Ark funds unloaded 134,749 shares of Coinbase Global  (COIN) , the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. That cache was valued at $30.9 million as of Monday’s close.

The stock has skyrocketed 187% over the past six months amid the surge in cryptocurrencies. So Wood, who has sold it steadily during the past three weeks, may think now is a good time to take profits. She remains an evangelist for cryptocurrencies.

The author owns shares of Meta, Amgen and Pfizer.

Also on the selling side, Ark funds unloaded 134,749 shares of Coinbase Global  (COIN) , the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. That cache was valued at $30.9 million as of Monday’s close.

The stock has skyrocketed 187% over the past six months amid the surge in cryptocurrencies. So Wood, who has sold it steadily during the past three weeks, may think now is a good time to take profits. She remains an evangelist for cryptocurrencies.

The author owns shares of Meta, Amgen and Pfizer.

Known to her devotees as Mama Cathie, Wood`s reputation soared after a stupendous return of 153% in 2020 and clear presentations of her investment philosophy in ubiquitous media appearances. Wood`s flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) , with $8.1 billion in assets, has generated a return of 25% for the past 12 months. Ark funds holdings are virtually all tech stocks. Ark Innovation`s annualized return is negative 24% for the past three years and a mere positive 3% for five years. Wood`s goal is for at least 15% annual returns over five-year stretches. Cathie Wood`s Market Philosophy Wood`s investment strategy isn`t hard to fathom. Ark`s ETFs generally buy young, small-company stocks in the high-tech categories of artificial intelligence, blockchain, DNA sequencing, energy storage, and robotics. Related: Cathie Wood`s Ark is suffering from a discouraging trend These stocks are quite volatile, of course, so the Ark funds are subject to rollercoaster rides. Investment research titan Morningstar is quite critical of Wood and Ark Innovation ETF. “ARK Innovation has dubious ability to successfully navigate the challenging territory it explores,” Morningstar analyst Robby Greengold wrote last year. “The strategy narrowly invests in stocks with paltry current earnings, elevated valuations, and highly correlated stock prices,” Greengold said. ” Wood has defended herself from Morningstar`s criticism. And I think style boxes will become a thing of the past, as technology blurs the lines between and among sectors. During Ark Innovation`s rally of the past 12 months, it saw a net investment outflow of $1. Cathie Wood's latest trades On Monday, Wood traded three stocks that she rarely touches. Ark Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) purchased 12,498 shares of social-media goliath Meta Platforms (META) , valued at $6. Fund manager buys and sells: Warren Buffett just sold shares of this popular streaming stock Paul Tudor Jones` hedge fund just made a big bet on Nvidia stock Stanley Druckenmiller just sold two AI tech stocks It`s hard to argue that Wood got a bargain, given the stock`s 167% surge over the past 12 months. Ark Genomic Revolution ETF (ARKG) snagged 10,981 shares of biotechnology stalwart Amgen (AMGN) , valued at $3. The stock has climbed 18% over the past 12 months. Meanwhile, Ark Genomic dumped 84,636 shares of pharmaceutical giant Pfizer (PFE) , valued at $2. How Pfizer fits into Wood`s investment philosophy is unclear. The stock has tumbled 36% over the past year. Also on the selling side, Ark funds unloaded 134,749 shares of Coinbase Global (COIN) , the country`s largest cryptocurrency exchange.

,"Woof! Why Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Floki Inu Are Barking Higher Today","For cryptocurrency investors, this rally is starting to look at lot like 2021. Investors in a range of meme tokens are seeing impressive surges in today's session, with Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE), Shiba Inu (CRYPTO: SHIB) and Floki Inu (CRYPTO: FLOKI) among the most-watched tokens today. As of 2:45 p.m. ET, these three dog-inspired meme coins surged 7.4%, 12.1%, and 68.7%, respectively, over the past 24 hours.

Now, these three meme tokens still have a way to go to achieve their previous all-time highs. But Floki Inu's incredible surge today puts this lesser-known meme token within striking distance, with another day of similar gains potentially driving this top-60 crypto project to new highs. Accordingly, with so much speculative capital flowing into this sector, investors are increasingly looking at meme tokens as a way to play this trend (given their increased volatility compared to mega-cap tokens).

Let's dive into what's driving these three meme cryptos higher, and whether this move is sustainable.
What gives?

Much ado has been made about the broader macro picture improving for the most speculative asset classes. Expectations of interest rate cuts this year have picked up, following dovish commentary from the Federal Reserve. And capital flows into cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) following the Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has many investors looking to diversify their portfolios into alternative assets considering the crypto sector once again.

That said, it's clear that the capital that's flowing into crypto from institutional money managers and those with big money to throw around isn't going into meme tokens. Many of these projects remain obscure, despite their multibillion-dollar valuations, with retail investors continuing to drive the vast majority of the trading volume around these digital assets.

Other key factors that appear to be at play driving these speculative meme tokens higher in recent days is the questionable distribution of these tokens (many are supported by significant inside/early investors with outsized positions, and the ability to influence how many tokens trade on the open market via token burns and other mechanisms), as well as a less sophisticated investor base looking to ride momentum trends alongside speculators (who often use leverage to amplify returns in times like these).
Can this rally continue?

Capital inflows from traditional financial markets into the crypto sector are real. Bitcoin is likely to remain the key beneficiary of this move, though I wouldn't rule out a positive ruling on spot Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) ETFs in the coming months, either.

This rally in meme tokens can really be boiled down to one specific driver -- speculation. As the crypto sector gains momentum, speculative leverage flows toward the areas of the crypto market that can generate the highest returns. In my mind, it's that simple right now. After all, there isn't much in the way of real utility being generated by these tokens (unless you consider the utility being part of an online community can provide).

For now, I'm highly skeptical of this meme token surge, and I think most investors feel the same way. Until there's some life-changing use case these meme tokens can provide, I'm going to happily observe this mania from the sidelines.

The company’s stock rose 5.8% Friday to close at $256.62 a share, its highest since December 2021.

When the biggest US cryptocurrency exchange went public in a direct listing in 2021, the reference price was set at $250 per share. Though there was early enthusiasm for the stock — shares rallied to an all-time high close of $350 in November 2021 — they ended their first 12 months of trading down 38%.

Coinbase shares remained under pressure for the next few years as a crypto-winter hit digital tokens and trading platforms came under increased scrutiny from the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

In the last year, however, Coinbase has ripped higher lifted by the price of Bitcoin, — which surged to an all-time high Friday — and the SEC’s approval of exchange-traded funds that invest directly in the digital asset. Shares of the trading platform are up more than 300% in the last 12 months.

Of course, surpassing the direct listing reference price may not bring much relief to any early investors still holding shares. In its first day of trading in 2021, the stock opened at a price of $381, mostly driven by retail buying, and rallied as much as 13% before falling to end the day lower. Coinbase ended 2022 down 86%.

Still, the stock has been grinding higher along with Bitcoin, the world’s largest crypto based on market value. Even two recent glitches on the platform — within less than a week of each other — which had some individual investors seeing zero balances in their Coinbase accounts hasn’t deterred share growth.

Other crypto-linked stocks have also gotten a lift during the latest jump in Bitcoin’s price. Shares of MicroStrategy Inc. and CleanSpark Inc. are all up on the year, continuing rallies from 2023.

,"A lot of people are going to get hurt' as Bitcoin tests all-time high, top economist warns","Bitcoin has been on a tear, ripping past $70,000 on Friday, a new record high for the world's largest crypto. While Bitcoin has seen more mainstream adoption, there are still some skeptics. Dr. Burton Malkiel, American economist and author of 'A Random Walk Down Wall Street,' joined TheStreet to discuss what he thinks of the crypto craze.
Full Video Transcript Below:

SARA SILVERSTEIN: And is there any piece of investment advice that you hear now or ever? That’s just a real pet peeve of yours that drives you crazy?

DR. BURTON MALIKEL:

Well, I will give you an example now where people are pouring money into what is a speculative asset class and where I think a lot of people are likely to be hurt, and that is Bitcoin.

And the problem, I think, is that in some sense, Bitcoin is a terrible currency to use. Why would I want to go and buy my cup of Starbucks coffee with a currency that’s up $2,000 or down $2,000 in a single day and I have no idea how many Bitcoin I’m going to have to use to buy my cup of coffee. In some sense, it’s so volatile, it’s not really a useful currency. And the problem is that it is useful for some purposes.

If I wanted to trade in drugs, I think I would be absolutely delighted to use Bitcoin where my purchases and sales would not be known to my credit card company or to my banker, or if I had gone into the computer system of a company and basically had programmed it so it wouldn’t work anymore. And I insisted on being paid a huge sum to unclog their computer system. If, in other words, ransomware, if I were in the business of ransomware, I think Bitcoin would be a terrific currency to use.

So there are uses and that’s ultimately, I think, going to be Bitcoin’s downfall because governments are not going to allow that to keep on happening. So I think there’s just an enormous risk involved in Bitcoin. People say Bitcoin will be fine because there’s a limited amount, there’s not a limited amount of cryptocurrency.

There are many other cryptocurrencies and there’ll be many more in the future. I’m not against technology. There will be government cryptocurrencies, but I think a lot of people are ultimately going to get very hurt by Bitcoin, which is now playing with a new high. And I can assure you if it goes up to a new high, you’re going to draw people in the FOMO crowd. I can’t miss this and I’m afraid a lot of people are going to be hurt. So if I had something to suggest where I’m really worried and what I think is actually the most bubbly of anything in the market, that’s the area that I would pick. I have no idea where Bitcoin is going. Could it go to $100,000? Absolutely, could it go to 200,000? Absolutely. But what I am sure of is that a lot of people who think they know exactly what it’s going to do, I’m afraid a lot of people are going to get hurt.","Bitcoin has been on a tear, ripping past $70,000 on Friday, a new record high for the world's largest crypto.

,SEC’s Gensler says crypto 'rife with abuses and fraud' as bitcoin surges to new all-time record,"SEC Chair Gary Gensler offered new warnings about cryptocurrencies as bitcoin (BTC-USD) surged to a new all-time high Friday, saying in an interview with Yahoo Finance that ""the whole field is rife with abuses and fraud.""

Investors, he added, should be aware that bitcoin is a ""highly speculative, volatile underlying asset.""

Read more: Is this a good time to invest in bitcoin?

His comments came minutes after the world's largest cryptocurrency reached another record high, climbing above $69,000 on Friday. Earlier this week it exceeded a previous high last set during a 2021 boom, reinforcing a remarkable comeback following a 2022 crash that created huge losses for investors.

The new frenzy is being driven by demand from a series of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds that started trading in January after receiving approvals from the SEC.

Gensler voted in favor of those ETFs. On Friday he said of that decision, ""I thought it was the most straightforward path forward.""

Many money managers are now also seeking approval from the SEC to launch spot ethereum ETFs tied to the world's second-largest cryptocurrency (ETH-USD).

Gensler on Friday declined to say whether he would approve those applications and instead spoke more broadly about the wider crypto field, saying it ""has challenges"" and is ""rife with abuses and fraud.""

He singled out intermediaries that pool the digital assets of investors without giving investors ""the proper disclosures,"" saying, ""I think that puts the investing public at risk.""

The SEC is suing Coinbase (COIN) and Binance, two big cryptocurrency exchanges, but Gensler didn't mention any specific companies by name.

Gensler also spoke about long-awaited climate-risk disclosure rules the SEC approved earlier this week. The rules require companies to disclose climate emissions that pose material risks to their business.

Large companies will be required to disclose the direct emissions from their operations and energy use, known as Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.

The SEC notably pared back the final ruling, trimming a provision that would have required companies to report their Scope 3 impact — that is, indirect emissions from suppliers and consumers.

The Scope 3 standard faced considerable resistance from conservatives and business groups who complained about high compliance costs and overreach, while climate-focused investors and lawmakers pushed for the SEC to include Scope 3 to help crack down on companies downplaying their full environmental impact.

Republicans and Democrats alike have criticized the rule, with Republican House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry and Senate Banking Committee ranking member Senator Tim Scott pledging to try to block it. Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren say the rule doesn’t go far enough.

When asked why the SEC opted to drop Scope 3, Gensler said, ""At the proposal stage, this area wasn't as developed"" and ""fewer companies right now, fewer issuers are making such information available."" So ""we chose at this time not to have a requirement.""

When asked whether the SEC could add it back, Gensler said ""it will be for future commissions to consider or whether to make adjustments to this again.""

The Scope 3 standard faced considerable resistance from conservatives and business groups who complained about high compliance costs and overreach, while climate-focused investors and lawmakers pushed for the SEC to include Scope 3 to help crack down on companies downplaying their full environmental impact.

Republicans and Democrats alike have criticized the rule, with Republican House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry and Senate Banking Committee ranking member Senator Tim Scott pledging to try to block it. Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren say the rule doesn’t go far enough.

When asked why the SEC opted to drop Scope 3, Gensler said, ""At the proposal stage, this area wasn't as developed"" and ""fewer companies right now, fewer issuers are making such information available."" So ""we chose at this time not to have a requirement.""

When asked whether the SEC could add it back, Gensler said ""it will be for future commissions to consider or whether to make adjustments to this again.""

Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","SEC Chair Gary Gensler offered new warnings about cryptocurrencies as bitcoin (BTC-USD) surged to a new all-time high Friday, saying in an interview with Yahoo Finance that ‘‘the whole field is rife with abuses and fraud. His comments came minutes after the world`s largest cryptocurrency reached another record high, climbing above $69,000 on Friday. ‘‘ Many money managers are now also seeking approval from the SEC to launch spot ethereum ETFs tied to the world's second-largest cryptocurrency (ETH-USD). Gensler on Friday declined to say whether he would approve those applications and instead spoke more broadly about the wider crypto field, saying it ‘‘has challenges‘‘ and is ‘‘rife with abuses and fraud. ‘‘ The SEC is suing Coinbase (COIN) and Binance, two big cryptocurrency exchanges, but Gensler didn't mention any specific companies by name. Gensler also spoke about long-awaited climate-risk disclosure rules the SEC approved earlier this week. The rules require companies to disclose climate emissions that pose material risks to their business.

,Bitcoin hit a new record high Tuesday. Why is cryptocurrency going up? We explain.,"Bitcoin jumped to a record high on Tuesday, the latest surge in the roller-coaster journey of the world's largest digital currency.

The price briefly crossed $69,000, surpassing its prior all-time high of $68,990.90 from Nov. 10, 2021, according to reporting from the Wall Street Journal, which cited data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.

Bitcoin's price has risen dramatically over the past year, fueled by regulatory approval for exchange-traded funds in the digital currency.

For years, everyday investors who wanted to trade digital currencies generally had to go to crypto exchanges, a potential deal-breaker for people unfamiliar with bitcoin.

That changed in January when federal regulators voted that ordinary American investors can buy and sell spot bitcoin ETFs in the same way they trade stocks.

The move opened up bitcoin investing to a larger swath of the American public, including potential investors who never quite understood what bitcoin is or how it works, let alone how to buy and sell it. Trading began in earnest.

The vote, taken by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, allowed the sale of exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, to the public.

Tuesday's record price “marks a turning point for crypto,"" said Nathan McCauley, CEO and co-founder of the crypto platform Anchorage Digital. ""Now, we are seeing exactly what happens when the market has safe, secure, and compliant access to the asset class—and institutions are just getting started.”

SEC approves bitcoin ETFs, clearing way for public trading

ETFs, for the uninitiated, are an investment vehicle akin to a mutual fund. They are traded on exchanges and typically track a specific index or “basket” of stocks, bonds or commodities. They function like stocks, with prices that change throughout the trading day, whereas mutual funds trade once a day at a single price.

Anticipation for the SEC vote drove up the price of bitcoin, which is notoriously volatile. The currency had traded at $17,000 at the start of last year.

The new ETFs are listed on Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, all highly regulated exchanges, according to Reuters.

Investing in a spot-bitcoin ETF allows investors to reap potential profits from bitcoin without the attendant risks of owning bitcoin directly, investment experts said.

Owning bitcoin directly means storing it in a digital ""wallet."" Using the wallet means maintaining passkeys, encrypted strings of letters and numbers that enable crypto transfers, according to Investopedia. The wallets can be appealing targets for hackers, and the system lacks federal regulation.

The federal securities agency had rejected prior bids for publicly traded bitcoin ETFs, on fears that bitcoin is susceptible to manipulation and fraud. The industry has sought ETF trading for more than a decade.

,Bitcoin Miners Need to Be Proactive to Hold Their Positions After Halving: Fidelity Digital Assets,"    Miners will need to maintain their existing hashrate, energy and real estate while competing with the rest of the network.

    The months after halving are the most difficult.

    The mining sector recovered after previous halvings, demonstrating the resilience of the network and the industry.

Bitcoin {{BTC}} holders have historically welcomed the quadrennial reward halving in the expectation it will drive prices higher, but miners must constantly plan for this event – which cuts their bitcoin earned by 50% – to avoid going bankrupt, Fidelity Digital Assets said in a report Monday.

“Not only do miners need to maintain their existing hash rate, energy and real estate, but they are also continuously competing with the entire network that is trying to do the same thing,” analyst Daniel Gray wrote.

Hashrate refers to the total combined computational power that is being used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain, such as Bitcoin. Miners need to be proactive and cannot afford to just maintain their position in the network, the report said.

“They must constantly push to acquire more hashrate as well as increase the efficiency of their hashrate, acquire lower-cost energy from cheaper sources, and expand their infrastructure to house any new machines,” Gray wrote. At the same time, every other miner is also bidding for the same resources.

Fidelity notes that the months after halving are the most difficult, because while bitcoin “plays catch-up to the immediate pay cut,” miners need capital reserves to offset the drop in revenue.

Still, as the protocol evolves, new layers could emerge bringing new use cases and more users, the note said.

“While the past halvings did see a flush-out of weaker miners, the industry ultimately recovered with more miners and hashrate than ever, demonstrating the resiliency of the network and industry,” the report added.

,SEC Delays Decision on Allowing Spot Bitcoin ETF Options Trading,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission delayed its decision on a rule change that would allow exchanges to list and trade options on spot bitcoin ETFs, the agency said in a filing earlier this week.

The SEC said that it would hold off weighing in about the listing of these options on the CBOE Exchange and the Miami International Securities Exchange until late April. The delay relates to multiple spot bitcoin ETFs, which are based primarily on the price of the largest cryptocurrency by market value.

""The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change,"" the SEC filing said.

The exchanges first applied to list options on bitcoin funds in January around the time that the SEC gave its seal of approval to 10 new spot bitcoin products. Since then, investor interest in cryptocurrency has skyrocketed with the spot bitcoin ETFs netting more than $9.3 billion in inflows as of the closing of equity markets on March 7, despite more than $10 billion in outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). That fund is a conversion from a trust so differs from the other spot bitcoin products.

BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) last week became the fastest ETF in history to surpass $10 billion in assets under management. Bitcoin hit a record high above $69,000 earlier this week, according to crypto data platform CoinMarketCap, breaking its previous high mark set in November 2021.

Analysts and financial advisors see using call and put options on bitcoin ETFs as a key strategy to address crypto's inherent volatility. Using put and call options hedge risk.

Options on ETFs work the same way that options on stocks do, since ETFs can be traded throughout the day. Investors use options by entering an agreement in which they buy or sell the asset at a specified price over a certain period. Options on bitcoin funds would apply an increasingly popular strategy to the successful spot bitcoin ETFs.

CBOE said in a statement in January that while it usually is able to list options on a new exchange traded product three days after it hits the market, it has to seek special permission from the SEC for commodity products, such as bitcoin.

In a blog post Wednesday, Grayscale Investments called ""access to exchange-listed options on GBTC and other spot Bitcoin ETPs...vital to the interests of investors.""

“Options would facilitate price discovery in the ETP’s shares, provide investors with greater choice and help investors navigate varying market conditions or achieve desired investment outcomes, such as generating income, hedging, or reducing volatility,"" the firm said.
Cryptocurrency Mania

While the SEC has allowed ETFs that give exposure to bitcoin futures since 2021, it only approved the spot bitcoin ETFs in January after a decade-long regulatory saga. But even before the approvals, Wall Street had increasingly been exploring the potential for other cryptocurrency-based investment products.

On March 4, the SEC delayed a decision on a BlackRock proposal for an exchange traded fund based on ether, the second largest digital asset in market capitalization. Ether has surged this year even more strongly than bitcoin, cracking $4,000 on Friday, the first time in two years that it has risen above this level, according to crypto publication CoinDesk.

,Michael Saylor: Bitcoin Can Compete With S&P 500 ETFs,"At the Bitcoin Atlantis conference in Madeira, Portugal, MicroStrategy Inc. Chairman Michael Saylor discussed Bitcoin and other topics with podcast host Natalie Brunell. One of the points of conversation surrounded the recently approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds ETFs and their ability to compete with other top asset classes and ETFs.

""We thought that maybe Bitcoin was a competitor to gold, but it has actually run up the leaderboard, and now it's starting to nip at the heels of the S&P 500 Index ETFs,"" Saylor said.

Don't Miss:

    If you invested $100 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here’s how much you’d have today.

    About 22% of the adult population in the U.S. own a share of Bitcoin, how much would $10 get you today?

Bitcoin and gold are viewed somewhat similarly by some investors, as they have a limited supply and can be seen as a hedge against inflation. However, gold has been around for millennia, while Bitcoin is barely 15 years old. Bitcoin has quickly risen the ranks and Saylor no longer sees gold as the main competitor to Bitcoin from an investment perspective.

Instead, Saylor believes that Bitcoin has the potential to compete with the largest ETFs in the world, namely the S&P 500 index ETFs, such as SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV).

In terms of market cap, the S&P 500 is leaps and bounds ahead of Bitcoin. It has a market cap of over $40 trillion, well above Bitcoin's $1.3 trillion. However, Bitcoin's recent performance, according to Saylor, could be a sign that Bitcoin is ready to compete with some of the largest funds in the world.

The spot Bitcoin ETFs were launched less than two months ago but have already surpassed more than $50 billion in combined total assets, according to Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. The ETFs also saw a record amount of inflows during their first 30 days.

Trending: Large boom in cryptocurrency and metaverse interest as BTC skyrockets — has Apple Vision Pro increased the demand for virtual real estate?

""These ETFs opened up an entire financial world of awareness, opportunity and functionality to the 99% of mainstream investors. You really can't underestimate just how profoundly important that is to the entire network,"" Saylor noted.

Saylor and Microstrategy are the largest institutional holders of Bitcoin, amassing a stash of 193,000 Bitcoins over the past several years. The investment as a whole is up more than 100% and is currently worth over $13.5 billion.

Despite the hugely successful investment, Saylor does not see the company selling any time soon. When asked about a potential exit strategy, Saylor said, ""Bitcoin is the exit strategy.""

Not only does Saylor not see an exit in the near future, but he is also taking on debt to buy more Bitcoin. MicroStrategy recently sold $700 million of convertible senior notes to buy even more Bitcoin.

As Bitcoin and spot ETFs continue to perform well and see more investment, it will be interesting to see how it plays out. Will Bitcoin ETFs catch up to the S&P 500 ETFs? Only time will tell.

,Bitcoin ETF Issuer VanEck Has Huge Crypto Growth Goals in Europe,"    VanEck Europe, the European division of the global asset manager, expects half of its assets under management to come from crypto in the future.

    Martijn Rozemuller, the CEO of VanEck Europe, said crypto will become more important and that he sees more potential for growth in that area than in others.

    VanEck Europe is the issuer of the VanEck Crypto and Blockchain Innovators UCITS ETF which holds Coinbase, Block, and MicroStrategy, among others.

VanEck, a 69-year-old asset manager with a history of bringing newfangled investments to customers, has high hopes for the role crypto will play in its European division.

Today, roughly 10% of the business' assets under management come from crypto products and 90% derive from conventional investing through ETFs, Martijn Rozemuller, the CEO of VanEck Europe, said in an interview.

“I think that balance will shift,” he said. “Crypto will become more important … and it will be closer to 50/50.”

It's a big growth goal from an emerging asset class, one that optimists see enticing a broader collection of investors, especially now that spot bitcoin ETFs have been approved in the U.S. That is familiar turf for VanEck, though, a U.S.-based company that was a pioneer in letting Americans buy international assets in the 1950s and then created a gold fund in the 1960s.

Rozemuller’s interest in crypto was something that he shared with VanEck CEO Jan Van Eck, and that potentially bolstered the acquisition and formation of the company’s Europe division. In 2018, VanEck acquired a Dutch ETF provider called Think ETF Asset Management, founded by Rozemuller.

“As soon as we got together with Jan, even probably before the acquisition, bitcoin was definitely a topic,” Rozemuller said. “Jan mentioned that he was already looking at ways to maybe do something in the U.S. We told him, 'Well, we're actually working on something in Europe, too.'”

VanEck introduced one of the 10 new U.S.-traded spot bitcoin ETFs that debuted in January, but it's been a participant in crypto its larger rival BlackRock. VanEck first filed to launch an ETF tied to the price of bitcoin in 2017.

VanEck Europe, the issuer of roughly 50 ETFs on stock exchanges across the continent, launched the VanEck Crypto and Blockchain Innovators UCITS ETF in 2021; it holds the stock of Coinbase Global, Block, Marathon Digital, Bitfarms and MicroStrategy, among other smaller allocations.

The fund is among the 15 top-performing ETFs in VanEck Europe’s portfolio by assets under management, even though it’s been a lot more volatile than most other products.

A big reason behind Rozemuller’s passion for crypto is one that isn’t often heard. He believes that people should be investing in a more “sensible way,” he said, not simply to chase performance and make a quick profit but rather to be in it for the long run. A lot of the investors of VanEck Europe’s crypto ETF are just that, he said. “I personally like that a lot.”

In the future, VanEck Europe, which describes itself as a firm that brings a “special twist,” wants to be the go-to issuer for all things “non-mainstream,” even though the company is already a leader in the field.

“There's some competitors that have really nice ETFs. There's competitors that really focus on exchange-traded notes when it comes to crypto. But there's not many that do both and do both really well and really make a positive difference,” Rozemuller said.","    VanEck Europe, the European division of the global asset manager, expects half of its assets under management to come from crypto in the future.

,Will Ripple (XRP) Ride the Crypto Bull Market and Reach $1 in 2024?,"The embattled cryptocurrency commonly known as Ripple, or technically XRP (CRYPTO: XRP), has risen more than 70% during the past year. The reason? A resurgence of investor interest in cryptocurrencies has raised the metaphorical tide, including pushing Bitcoin to within shouting distance of its all-time highs.

But unlike Bitcoin, XRP is nowhere near its former high of $2.78 per share. That's because an ongoing litigation cloud is casting a large shadow. Ripple Labs, the creators behind XRP, is locked in a lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission over how the token should be regulated and the potential punishment for selling the token to institutional investors.

That puts investors in a tight spot when determining where XRP's price could go, and the possible outcomes are admittedly pretty wide-ranging. Here is what you need to know.
Abundant long-term potential

Ultimately, supply and demand determine crypto prices. In other words, how much are buyers willing to pay, and how much will sellers let the coins go for? The more buyers, the higher the price goes, and vice versa. But the long-term dynamics of this are more complex. It boils down to what XRP does and what benefits it could provide to society that ultimately fuel the long-term demand.

XRP is a coin that operates on the Ripple blockchain. The Ripple ecosystem is designed primarily for cross-border transactions. Cross-border payments are potentially a tremendous opportunity, as even in today's economy money moves slowly. Most cross-border transactions go on the global SWIFT network, which can take days to settle funds. Ripple can do this in seconds.

The speed of cross-border transactions on Ripple makes it a potentially appealing tool for global banks, especially in emerging markets. XRP is pre-mined with a capped 100 billion token supply, unlike many cryptos. That means long-term adoption of XRP could support price appreciation.
Serious short-term risks

The main problem holding investors back is the uncertainty of a lawsuit between Ripple Labs, the creators of Ripple and XRP, and the SEC. The courts have already ruled that Ripple Labs by selling coins to institutions has violated securities laws, so there are real risks that the legal process will ultimately damage the appeal of Ripple and XRP.

That could be as monetary damages to Ripple Labs, which controls much of the operational aspects of the blockchain, or regulatory impacts if harsh rules come out to govern how consumers use cryptocurrencies.

It's a situation with such wide-ranging and unpredictable outcomes that it's wise for many to err on the side of caution, and that's why the price hasn't quite taken off like the prices of other cryptos have during the past year.

Can XRP rally to $1?

As I said earlier, short-term prices are market-driven. So can XRP rally to $1 from today's price of about $0.65? Absolutely! Will it? Unfortunately, nobody can know for sure. I like the odds if cryptocurrencies continue to rally. Leading crypto exchange Coinbase recently reported that a surge in trading traffic managed to crash its servers, so that speaks to how much investor interest there is in cryptocurrencies right now.

If Ripple makes out well in court, it would likely tremendously boost XRP prices. You get the sense that the investor base is waiting to see how things shake out before leaning too heavily one way or the other.

That makes a dollar-cost average strategy necessary for managing risk. If you want to own XRP, buy a little at a time in regular increments. That way you'll slowly build an investment with multiple purchases that average a buy-in price. It will ensure you don't buy at the absolute top or bottom and position you for success if XRP prices rise over time.

Should you invest $1,000 in XRP right now?

    Nvidia’s stock completes dramatic reversal lower not seen in almost seven years

    A Palm Springs house sold for $1.3 million in 2023 after zero days on the market — up 113% on its 2021 sale price. It’s now in a $625,000 short sale. How is this possible?

    ‘I gave up a job that I loved passionately’: My husband secretly set up a trust that includes our home and his investments. What should I do?

    AMD’s AI story is ‘unfolding fast.’ This bull sees a 25%-plus stock gain ahead.

In general, “rising asset prices create bullish sentiment which spills over into other asset classes, making investors feel comfortable making new investments,” said Alex Pickard, vice president of research at investment firm Research Affiliates. “Positive liquidity flows increase asset prices.”

On Comex, gold futures GC00 GCJ24 scored a fresh record-high settlement, with prices Friday ending at $2,185.50 an ounce. They’ve tallied a sixth straight record finish, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Read: Gold scores another record finish. Here’s who isn’t buying.

Bitcoin BTCUSD reached a fresh record on Friday too, topping $70,000. On March 7, the S&P 500 index SPX set a record close at 5,157.36, while the Nasdaq Composite COMP closed at a record 16,274.94 on March 1.

Also read: There’s one big mystery in the everything rally: gold’s record-setting ascent

There has been “a lot of liquidity on the sidelines” in relatively high yielding Treasurys, which have been looking less attractive as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicates the Fed is close to cutting interest rates, and as riskier assets appreciate, said Pickard.

He expects continued market strength across gold, bitcoin, U.S. stocks, and other markets, as this money gets deployed into riskier assets. Other global stock markets hitting all-time highs include Japan. Japan’s Nikkei 225 JP:NIK set a record on March 4 at 40,109.23.

“Valuations across markets are rising as anticipation of interest rate cuts grows,” said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics.

“With a prospect of looser U.S. monetary policy, asset values are poised to rise,” he told MarketWatch. “This is likely to support everything from U.S. equities to residential real-estate prices.”

The U.S. dollar is also likely to weaken on Fed rate cuts, and geopolitical tensions are high and rising – “both of which are supportive of gold prices.”
Bitcoin vs. gold

Bitcoin, meanwhile, is benefiting from the prospect of Fed interest rate cuts, a weaker dollar, and geopolitical tensions, said Schenker.

“A swarm of hype locusts have been buying into bitcoin following SEC spot Bitcoin ETF approvals earlier this year and ahead of next month’s redemption halving,” he said. Halving is a mechanism written into the Bitcoin blockchain’s algorithm to control the coin’s limited supply.

Read: Bitcoin is halving again in April. Here’s why it’s different this time.

Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have performed well since they started trading in January. As of March 7, the iShares Bitcoin ETF IBIT, for example, has seen a net fund inflow of about $9.45 billion since Jan. 12, according to Dow Jones Market Data analysis of FactSet data. Among gold ETFs, however, SPDR Gold Shares GLD has seen year-to-date net fund outflow of $4.15 billion.

Bitcoin is a “digitally native asset,” while gold is a “physical asset” – one that investors can hold in their hand, said Research Affiliates’ Pickard. That’s an attractive quality of gold, he said, so gold prices are going up through physical purchases, while gold ETFs experience outflows.

On the other hand, for many investors, a bitcoin ETF is “a safer and easier way to access bitcoin than to buy the actual coin,” so bitcoin prices are going up through ETF purchases, Pickard said.

Read: Did bitcoin ETF frenzy drive the crypto to a record? How the experts see it.

Pickard expects bitcoin to lure investors away from gold, with the “lure” being the “media, traditional and social, and word-of-mouth.”

“We are living in an attention economy, and bitcoin gets more attention than gold,” he said, adding bitcoin investors are likely growing faster than gold investors.

Even so, gold and bitcoin can both see prices rise because of “more buying than selling within both markets,” said Pickard. “I expect both assets to go up, but for bitcoin to outperform gold.”
S&P 500 vs. gold

Meanwhile, looking at gold’s changes in value versus the U.S. stock market, or the S&P 500 index more specifically, can help gauge investor confidence.

Comparing gold with the S&P 500 over time can provide “a sense of whether equity investor confidence is rising or falling, and when it might be excessively optimistic or pessimistic,” Jessica Rabe, co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a note this week.

She pointed out that S&P 500/gold price ratio does a “great job of highlighting long-term trends in equity investor sentiment.”

The S&P 500 trading at 2.4 times the price of gold is within one standard deviation of the long run average of 1.6, she said. So “neither stocks nor gold is materially mispriced relative to the other asset based on this long run math,” said Rabe.

Pickard, meanwhile, said that the ratio reading of 2.4, “which it has been around for about 5 years,” indicates that investors are “both equally confident in the S&P 500 and gold.”

A break above 2.75 would indicate increased equity investor confidence relative to gold, while a drop below 2.0 would indicate more investor confidence in gold versus equities, he said.

Bitcoin BTCUSD reached a fresh record on Friday too, topping $70,000. On March 7, the S&P 500 index SPX set a record close at 5,157.36, while the Nasdaq Composite COMP closed at a record 16,274.94 on March 1.

There has been “a lot of liquidity on the sidelines” in relatively high yielding Treasurys, which have been looking less attractive as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicates the Fed is close to cutting interest rates, and as riskier assets appreciate, said Pickard.

He expects continued market strength across gold, bitcoin, U.S. stocks, and other markets, as this money gets deployed into riskier assets. Other global stock markets hitting all-time highs include Japan. Japan’s Nikkei 225 JP:NIK set a record on March 4 at 40,109.23.

“Valuations across markets are rising as anticipation of interest rate cuts grows,” said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics.

“With a prospect of looser U.S. monetary policy, asset values are poised to rise,” he told MarketWatch. “This is likely to support everything from U.S. equities to residential real-estate prices.”

The U.S. dollar is also likely to weaken on Fed rate cuts, and geopolitical tensions are high and rising – “both of which are supportive of gold prices.”
Bitcoin vs. gold

Bitcoin, meanwhile, is benefiting from the prospect of Fed interest rate cuts, a weaker dollar, and geopolitical tensions, said Schenker.

“A swarm of hype locusts have been buying into bitcoin following SEC spot Bitcoin ETF approvals earlier this year and ahead of next month’s redemption halving,” he said. Halving is a mechanism written into the Bitcoin blockchain’s algorithm to control the coin’s limited supply.

Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have performed well since they started trading in January. As of March 7, the iShares Bitcoin ETF IBIT, for example, has seen a net fund inflow of about $9.45 billion since Jan. 12, according to Dow Jones Market Data analysis of FactSet data. Among gold ETFs, however, SPDR Gold Shares GLD has seen year-to-date net fund outflow of $4.15 billion.

Bitcoin is a “digitally native asset,” while gold is a “physical asset” – one that investors can hold in their hand, said Research Affiliates’ Pickard. That’s an attractive quality of gold, he said, so gold prices are going up through physical purchases, while gold ETFs experience outflows.

On the other hand, for many investors, a bitcoin ETF is “a safer and easier way to access bitcoin than to buy the actual coin,” so bitcoin prices are going up through ETF purchases, Pickard said.

Pickard expects bitcoin to lure investors away from gold, with the “lure” being the “media, traditional and social, and word-of-mouth.”

“We are living in an attention economy, and bitcoin gets more attention than gold,” he said, adding bitcoin investors are likely growing faster than gold investors.

Even so, gold and bitcoin can both see prices rise because of “more buying than selling within both markets,” said Pickard. “I expect both assets to go up, but for bitcoin to outperform gold.”
S&P 500 vs. gold

Meanwhile, looking at gold’s changes in value versus the U.S. stock market, or the S&P 500 index more specifically, can help gauge investor confidence.

Comparing gold with the S&P 500 over time can provide “a sense of whether equity investor confidence is rising or falling, and when it might be excessively optimistic or pessimistic,” Jessica Rabe, co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a note this week.

Mark Connors, director of research at digital-asset manager 3iQ Corp, said he believes bitcoin BTCUSD is likely to reach as high as $100,000 before its next halving event — which is expected to happen on or around April 20 — as exchange-traded funds investing in the token attract institutional inflows.

Read: 5 ways bitcoin ETFs are already changing how crypto is traded

It is the first time in bitcoin’s history that the crypto has reached an all-time high within a year before halving, Connors said in a call with MarketWatch on Friday. That excludes bitcoin’s first halving in 2012, when crypto trading was at a very early stage, he noted. To date, bitcoin has had three halving events.

Halving is a mechanism written into the Bitcoin blockchain’s algorithm to control the coin’s supply, which has a cap of 21 million. At halvings, the reward for bitcoin mining is cut in half, meaning miners will receive 50% fewer tokens for verifying transactions. Halvings are scheduled to happen after every 210,000 blocks that are mined — or about every four years — until the maximum supply of bitcoin is released.

Bitcoin rallied before halving this year “because we’re now in a demand shock, while everything before was about a supply shock,” Connors said.

The investor base for bitcoin has broadened since bitcoin ETFs started trading on Jan. 11,​​ Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said in a call.

Meanwhile, BlackRock this week filed amendments with the Securities and Exchange Commission to add bitcoin into both its Strategic Income Opportunities Fund (BSIIX) and its Global Allocation Fund (MALOX).

“These filings from BlackRock help strengthen the case for bitcoin in a portfolio for the potential diversification benefits and enhanced returns,” said Charles Yu, vice president of research at Galaxy Digital.

“There will likely be a much larger impact on BTC demand from second-order effects of bitcoin ETF approval as a wide range of other investment vehicles would be likely to add bitcoin to their portfolios (e.g., mutual funds, closed-end, and private funds, etc.) across various investment objectives and strategies,” Yu wrote in a Friday note.

As bitcoin rallies, ether ETHUSD has also been on the rise, trading near $4,000 on Friday, according to CoinDesk data. The second-largest crypto by market capitalization is still more than 17% off its record high of $4,865.57, reached in November 2021.

Investors are awaiting May 23, a critical deadline before which the SEC must decide whether to approve spot ether ETFs.

Still, even if an ether ETF were to be approved, “the impact on the market might be minimal compared to bitcoin,” noted Thomas Tang, vice president of investments at crypto venture firm Ryze Labs.

Six ether-futures ETFs generated a total of $2 million of trading volume on their first day of trading, while the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF BITO, the first ETF investing in bitcoin futures, saw trading volume of more than $1 billion on its debut, Tang noted.

,Bitcoin Miners Are Devouring Energy at a Record Pace During the Crypto Runup,"(Bloomberg) -- After recovering from a near-death experience during the most recent crypto winter, Bitcoin miners are back in survival mode — spending billions of dollars on equipment and drawing energy at a record pace ahead of an update in the digital currency’s code that threatens revenue streams.

    Is Now the Right Time to Invest in Bitcoin?

    The World Has Too Much Wine, and Farmers Are Ripping Up Vines

The surge in activity is sparked by a runup in the world’s largest cryptocurrency, fueled by newly launched spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, and a quadrennial event called the halving that is slated to take place in April. Bitcoin has surged more than fourfold since plunging by 64% in 2022 amid a series of crypto industry bankruptcies and scandals.

Since February 2023, 13 of the top mining companies have placed orders for over $1 billion worth of specialized computers, according to data compiled by TheMinerMag based on public filings. CleanSpark Inc. and Riot Platforms Inc. led the group, spending as much as $473 million and $415 million, respectively, on the rigs.

The machines are being purchased to help miners increase efficiency for their operations and lock in favorable electricity rates. Miners are in constant search of cheap power because they use energy-hungry computers to validate records of transactions on the blockchain to earn rewards in the form of Bitcoin.

“Scale matters because you can get machines for better rates, bigger energy deals and drive down the cost of development,” said Asher Genoot, chief executive at Hut 8 Corp., one of the largest publicly traded Bitcoin miners. “When you have scale, you have more marginal and growth profits and you can cover your big costs.”

All the activity is driving miners to consume energy at a record pace. Last month, miners drew a record 19.6 gigawatts of power, up from 12.1 gigawatts the same period in 2023, according to an estimate by Coin Metrics. That’s equivalent to the electricity capacity that can power about 3.8 million homes in Texas, where many of the mining operations are located.

“If we assume power draw was consistent over the course of the month, we can multiply by 696 (24 hours times 29 days) to get 13.64 TWh (terawatt-hours) of energy consumed by the Bitcoin network over the course of last month,” said Coin Metrics Senior Solutions Engineer Parker Merritt. Bitcoin mining consumed 121 terawatt-hours of power in 2023, the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance estimates — similar to Argentina’s use.

Bitcoin miners were some of the best performing stocks last year, allowing the companies to raise capital by selling newly issued shares through “at-the-market” offering programs. That’s in addition to the rising value of Bitcoin held on the books of the miners. Bitcoin reached a record high of more than $70,000 on March 8.

The rising price of Bitcoin “allows most miners to remain profitable,” said Zachary Bradford, CEO and president at CleanSpark, adding that his firm was profitable at lower prices.

Shares of Marathon and CleanSpark have risen by almost 600% and 900%, respectively, since December 2022. According to TheMinerMag data, both firms along with Riot, Hive Digital Technologies and Iris Energy Ltd. raised over $2 billion from selling shares since June 2023, when the crypto market started to rebound.

“The most efficient miners will benefit the most as the increase in Bitcoin price will push even more profits to the bottom line,” said Bradford.

Miners are constantly competing for a reward since the network only gives it to the first to successfully process a unit of data. The fierce competition is evidenced in mining difficulty, a measure of the amount of computing power to mine Bitcoin. The bi-weekly gauge has posted some of the largest increases, pushing the figure to all-time highs several times since January 2023, according to data from btc.com.

The more computing power a miner has, the more likely it will get a reward. But that reward will be reduced after the halving, which further limits the supply of Bitcoin.

“With the halving coming in mid April, revenue for miners will fall significantly, forcing some of them into the territory of negative margins,” said Ethan Vera, chief operations officer at crypto-mining services provider Luxor Technology. “Some miners will capitulate, while many will find creative solutions to remain profitable.”

Danger of Scaling

The rapid expansion comes with risks as seen in the last crypto bull run in late 2021. A flurry of mining companies went public and raised billions of dollars from the equity and debt markets. Companies borrowed a record amount of money and when the market crashed in 2022 so did miners. Two of the largest firms at the time, Core Scientific Inc. and Compute North declared bankruptcy with other miners warning of a liquidity crunch. Core Scientific has since emerged out of bankruptcy and relisted in January.

“There is a danger in which you scale and start compromising on the cost of energy, the cost of machines and the costs of certain paybacks,” Genoot said. “That’s why so many companies went bankrupt in 2022 because people would scale at all costs.”

Phil Harvey, CEO at Sabre56, a large Bitcoin mining operator based in Dubai, said he knows a miner that has machines, worth $350 million or $400 million, that it purchased this year but has no where to put them.

The company has “no ability to turn them on,” he said. “That is not uncommon.”

The bi-weekly gauge has posted some of the largest increases, pushing the figure to all-time highs several times since January 2023, according to data from btc.com.

The more computing power a miner has, the more likely it will get a reward. But that reward will be reduced after the halving, which further limits the supply of Bitcoin.

“With the halving coming in mid April, revenue for miners will fall significantly, forcing some of them into the territory of negative margins,” said Ethan Vera, chief operations officer at crypto-mining services provider Luxor Technology. “Some miners will capitulate, while many will find creative solutions to remain profitable.”

Danger of Scaling

The rapid expansion comes with risks as seen in the last crypto bull run in late 2021. A flurry of mining companies went public and raised billions of dollars from the equity and debt markets. Companies borrowed a record amount of money and when the market crashed in 2022 so did miners. Two of the largest firms at the time, Core Scientific Inc. and Compute North declared bankruptcy with other miners warning of a liquidity crunch. Core Scientific has since emerged out of bankruptcy and relisted in January.

“There is a danger in which you scale and start compromising on the cost of energy, the cost of machines and the costs of certain paybacks,” Genoot said. “That’s why so many companies went bankrupt in 2022 because people would scale at all costs.”

Phil Harvey, CEO at Sabre56, a large Bitcoin mining operator based in Dubai, said he knows a miner that has machines, worth $350 million or $400 million, that it purchased this year but has no where to put them.

The company has “no ability to turn them on,” he said. “That is not uncommon.”

©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","(Bloomberg) -- After recovering from a near-death experience during the most recent crypto winter, Bitcoin miners are back in survival mode — spending billions of dollars on equipment and drawing energy at a record pace ahead of an update in the digital currency`s code that threatens revenue streams. The surge in activity is sparked by a runup in the world`s largest cryptocurrency, fueled by newly launched spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, and a quadrennial event called the halving that is slated to take place in April. Since February 2023, 13 of the top mining companies have placed orders for over $1 billion worth of specialized computers, according to data compiled by TheMinerMag based on public filings. The machines are being purchased to help miners increase efficiency for their operations and lock in favorable electricity rates. Miners are in constant search of cheap power because they use energy-hungry computers to validate records of transactions on the blockchain to earn rewards in the form of Bitcoin. “Scale matters because you can get machines for better rates, bigger energy deals and drive down the cost of development,” said Asher Genoot, chief executive at Hut 8 Corp. , one of the largest publicly traded Bitcoin miners. ” All the activity is driving miners to consume energy at a record pace. 64 TWh (terawatt-hours) of energy consumed by the Bitcoin network over the course of last month,” said Coin Metrics Senior Solutions Engineer Parker Merritt. Bitcoin mining consumed 121 terawatt-hours of power in 2023, the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance estimates — similar to Argentina`s use. Bitcoin miners were some of the best performing stocks last year, allowing the companies to raise capital by selling newly issued shares through “at-the-market” offering programs. The rising price of Bitcoin “allows most miners to remain profitable,” said Zachary Bradford, CEO and president at CleanSpark, adding that his firm was profitable at lower prices. According to TheMinerMag data, both firms along with Riot, Hive Digital Technologies and Iris Energy Ltd. raised over $2 billion from selling shares since June 2023, when the crypto market started to rebound. “The most efficient miners will benefit the most as the increase in Bitcoin price will push even more profits to the bottom line,” said Bradford. The fierce competition is evidenced in mining difficulty, a measure of the amount of computing power to mine Bitcoin. The bi-weekly gauge has posted some of the largest increases, pushing the figure to all-time highs several times since January 2023, according to data from btc.

,Bitcoin is setting itself up for another fall,"When it comes to Bitcoin — and all cryptocurrencies, especially now — a deep breath is in order before one invests.

Bitcoin hit an all-time closing high on Thursday at $69,294, an astonishing rebound from a crash in 2022 that saw the cryptocurrency fall 77% to $15,800.

Many assumed the mania would kill bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies generally. Some muttered or yelled words like ""Good riddance.""

By the end of 2023, however, bitcoin was back in a big way, closing up 172% on the year to around $43,000. It has risen 61% just this year. And most of that gain started in February.

No doubt a terrific gain, although Nvidia  (NVDA)  is up 77% on the year at $875.28. And that's despite a 5.6% slump on Friday.

Bitcoin enthusiasts and promoters are ecstatic with its performance, convinced it's heading to $100,000 and ultimately will vie with gold as a way to hedge one's wealth against inflation and economic turmoil.

Skeptics abound, worried bitcoin is getting way too expensive and potentially ruinous to naive investors.

The late Charles Munger of Berkshire Hathaway  (BRK.B)  had no use for Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency traders were participants in a get-rich-quick scheme, contributing little to civilization, he told one interviewer.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has called Bitcoin a fraud, worthless and no better than a pet rock.

There's no disputing its volatility. An example: Bitcoin jumped nearly 8% on Monday, dropped 8.6% the next day and rose 8.5% on Wednesday.

By many traditional momentum measures, bitcoin at current levels is overbought and increasingly vulnerable to an abrupt selloff.

Its relative strength index has been largely above 75 since early February, a key measure on whether an investment is overbought.

And yet, bitcoin has enjoyed a huge runup this year. Blame two very specific factors.

The ETFs arrive

First, after years of intense lobbying and litigation by Wall Street, nine exchange-traded funds were launched in January aimed at making it easier to invest in bitcoin. (More are expected later.)

Exchange-traded funds are organized to invest in pools of something, usually stocks. In this case, the ETFs were organized to buy into bitcoin and take the risk and costs of taking positions in the crypto off investors' hands.

The ETFs have pulled in more than $52 billion in new money in about two months, far faster than Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg Intelligence was expecting. Balchunas, who covers crypto news, told CoinDesk TV he thought it might take three to six months to generate that much cash.

ETFs built around gold took three years to pull in that much cash.

The ETFs have all had terrific runs since their opening day of trading on Jan. 11, rising roughly 48% to 52% each.

The iShares Bitcoin Trust  (IBIT) , managed by money-management giant Blackstone, is up 48.5% since Jan. 11.

The biggest ETF, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust  (GBTC) , is up 52% since January.

The S&P 500 is up 8.1% this year. The Nasdaq-100 Index, which includes Nvidia, is up 7.4%.
The halving is coming in April

In April comes the second big influence on the price of bitcoin. It's called halving and works because of the way bitcoin is structured.

Every transaction is registered in a block and verified by solving complex math problems using computers. Once the problems are solved, the block goes at the end of what's called the blockchain.

When a block goes into the chain, as Quartz explains, it creates a number of bitcoins. Whoever gets a block into the chain gets rewarded with 6.25 bitcoin. Each coin is worth about $388,000. In April, the reward rate is expected to be cut in half to 3.125 bitcoin.

The halving, which occurs every four years or so, is expected to occur around April 21 and will fuel a bitcoin price jump.

Aaron Arnold, the co-founder of influential crypto markets channel ""Altcoin Daily,"" believes prices could hit $80,000.

That's because halving is designed to create scarcity. it's like gold, which has a limited global supply and has evolved into an asset investors can use as a hedge against inflation and over-speculation.

Bitcoin was designed to have a limited supply. The original code that created it allows a maximum of 21 million coins, which might take several decades to distribute.

    Analysts revamp interest rate targets following Fed meeting

This explains why Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Investment Management, sees one bitcoin worth $2.3 million sometime in the future. She has also more specifically predicted it would rise to $1.5 million by 2030.

ARK Invest manages the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF  (ARKB) , up 48.4% since trading started on Jan. 11.

Wood assumes that Bitcoin will become so valuable that it will represent something on the order of 19% of global investable assets.
What is Bitcoin for

Wood's projection tells us something about what Bitcoin is not and what Bitcoin is.

    Bitcoin is not a currency. No matter what anyone tells you, especially crypto supporters. It's hard to buy a house, a car, dinner at a good restaurant using bitcoin.

    Bitcoin is, in fact, a vehicle for speculation.

Bitcoin also tends to track some stock indexes, especially the Nasdaq-100 Index.

And it crashes, like the 77% crash in 2022. Another crash that started in late 2017 saw bitcoin fall 84% over the next year.

It displayed its volatility briefly in January, rising 10% in the first eight days on the month and falling 16% over the next 15 days.

The chance to make huge gains in short periods of time attracts many naive investors, many Bitcoin critics argue, including Burton Malkiel, author of the influential book A Random Walk Down Main Street.

""I can assure you if it goes up to a new high, you’re going to draw people in the FOMO crowd,"" he told Sara Silverstein, editor-in-chief of theStreet. ""I can’t miss this, and I’m afraid a lot of people are going to be hurt.""

""I'd pass on Bitcoin for now, despite setting a new high for a fleeting moment. There are more prudent investment opportunities,"" Adam Spatacco wrote on the Motley Fool.

,Billionaire Hedge Funder Bill Ackman Mulls Bitcoin,"Pershing Square Capital Management founder and CEO Bill Ackman turned some of his attention to Bitcoin {{BTC}} on Saturday afternoon, cheekily suggesting a scenario in which the price for the world's largest crypto could soar far higher than anyone might imagine.

""Bitcoin price rise leads to increased mining and greater energy use, driving up the cost of energy, causing inflation to rise and the dollar to decline, driving demand for Bitcoin and increased mining, driving demand for energy and the cycle continues,"" said Ackman in a post on X.

""Bitcoin goes to infinity, energy prices skyrocket, and the economy collapses,"" he continued. ""Maybe I should buy some Bitcoin.""

""The problem of course is that it also works in reverse,"" he later added.

Unsurprisingly, Ackman's post drew quick response from many in the Bitcoin community, including from MicroStrategy (MSTR) founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, who offered to speak to Ackman directly on the subject.

""You should buy some bitcoin, but not for the reasons cited above,"" said Saylor. ""Most bitcoin miners are driving the cost of electricity down for other consumers, not up. Let me know if you would like to discuss 1 on 1.""

Ackman mostly has steered clear of bitcoin and crypto in general, though in 2022 said he was a small investor in some crypto projects and crypto venture funds.

,"With Nvidia Up 80% This Year, Are There Any AI Crypto Tokens You Should Be Buying Now?","For crypto investors, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has become the one stock to watch for clues about the future direction of artificial intelligence (AI) crypto tokens. As Nvidia's stock goes, so goes the market for AI crypto tokens.

So with Nvidia shares surging after a monster earnings report in February, AI crypto tokens are also surging. Some are up 300% during the past month, and it all stems from a renewed sense of excitement around the AI market. But are any of these AI crypto tokens actually worth buying?
What is Fetch.ai?

Recognizing that it's still the very early innings for artificial intelligence, the one AI crypto token that has my attention right now is Fetch.ai (CRYPTO: FET), which is up almost 400% in the past 30 days and nearly 300% for the year. As of March 7, Fetch.ai had a market cap of $2.2 billion and ranked 51st among all cryptos in terms of overall market cap.

The goal of the token is to build, deploy, and monetize AI by creating an open network for AI agents. That's a mouthful, but all it really means is that Fetch.ai wants to offer a marketplace for paid AI services.

Anytime you need a task fulfilled by an AI bot, you would theoretically go to the Fetch.ai marketplace and hire the right one to do the job for you. You would then use the Fetch crypto token to pay for the service.
Fetch.ai vs. ChatGPT

What makes Fetch.ai so interesting is that it sounds very similar to the concept for the new ChatGPT Store, which now enables you to hire customized AI bots to do certain tasks for you. Given that a lot more people know about ChatGPT than Fetch.ai, I'm not entirely convinced that the crypto should be worth $2.2 billion, but you can start to see why some investors are getting excited about its long-term prospects.

Where things get interesting is if Fetch.ai can sell enterprises (i.e., huge corporations) on the concept of these AI bots. One new partner is Deutsche Telekom, which is looking at potential uses for AI bots.

This could become a great example of AI bots providing utility on a vast scale, and it ties back to the whole idea of investing in Nvidia in the first place. After all, big blue chips like Deutsche Telekom are the ones that are going to be buying Nvidia's semiconductors and using its data centers.
Caveats for investors

You definitely need to be doing your due diligence in this sector if you want to benefit from the long-term convergence of AI and crypto. Otherwise, you could wind up in the same situation as we saw with metaverse crypto tokens back in 2021-22.

Investors sensed a huge market opportunity around the metaverse, and a few big metaverse crypto tokens eventually attained billion-dollar market caps. But nobody these days is buying metaverse crypto tokens.

And that's because metaverse crypto tokens never figured out how to appeal to more than young gamers and early tech adopters. Big brands set up shop in the metaverse, hoping to find new customers and new sources of revenue, but things never really turned out as planned.

And that's one concern that I have about Fetch.ai. Sure, the idea of using paid AI bots sounds great, but will it ever appeal to a mainstream audience? It would be great to see more examples of people actually using Fetch.ai bots in their daily lives.
Should you just buy Nvidia instead?

If forced to pick just one AI crypto token right now, it would be Fetch.ai. For a little more than $2 per token, you can theoretically gain access to nearly unlimited upside if the use case for autonomous AI agents in the enterprise market plays out as expected.

That said, it might be better for risk-averse investors to focus on blue chip names in the AI market such as Nvidia rather than trying to make speculative bets on AI crypto tokens they have never heard of. Picking winners in an emerging tech market is always dicey, and so for now, I'm sticking with Nvidia, up more than 80% for the year, as the best way to play the future in AI.

Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

You definitely need to be doing your due diligence in this sector if you want to benefit from the long-term convergence of AI and crypto. Otherwise, you could wind up in the same situation as we saw with metaverse crypto tokens back in 2021-22.

Investors sensed a huge market opportunity around the metaverse, and a few big metaverse crypto tokens eventually attained billion-dollar market caps. But nobody these days is buying metaverse crypto tokens.

And that's because metaverse crypto tokens never figured out how to appeal to more than young gamers and early tech adopters. Big brands set up shop in the metaverse, hoping to find new customers and new sources of revenue, but things never really turned out as planned.

And that's one concern that I have about Fetch.ai. Sure, the idea of using paid AI bots sounds great, but will it ever appeal to a mainstream audience? It would be great to see more examples of people actually using Fetch.ai bots in their daily lives.
Should you just buy Nvidia instead?

If forced to pick just one AI crypto token right now, it would be Fetch.ai. For a little more than $2 per token, you can theoretically gain access to nearly unlimited upside if the use case for autonomous AI agents in the enterprise market plays out as expected.

That said, it might be better for risk-averse investors to focus on blue chip names in the AI market such as Nvidia rather than trying to make speculative bets on AI crypto tokens they have never heard of. Picking winners in an emerging tech market is always dicey, and so for now, I'm sticking with Nvidia, up more than 80% for the year, as the best way to play the future in AI.

Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:

With Nvidia Up 80% This Year, Are There Any AI Crypto Tokens You Should Be Buying Now? was originally published by The Motley Fool","For crypto investors, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has become the one stock to watch for clues about the future direction of artificial intelligence (AI) crypto tokens. As Nvidia`s stock goes, so goes the market for AI crypto tokens. So with Nvidia shares surging after a monster earnings report in February, AI crypto tokens are also surging. But are any of these AI crypto tokens actually worth buying? Recognizing that it's still the very early innings for artificial intelligence, the one AI crypto token that has my attention right now is Fetch. 2 billion and ranked 51st among all cryptos in terms of overall market cap. Anytime you need a task fulfilled by an AI bot, you would theoretically go to the Fetch. You would then use the Fetch crypto token to pay for the service. ai so interesting is that it sounds very similar to the concept for the new ChatGPT Store, which now enables you to hire customized AI bots to do certain tasks for you. This could become a great example of AI bots providing utility on a vast scale, and it ties back to the whole idea of investing in Nvidia in the first place. After all, big blue chips like Deutsche Telekom are the ones that are going to be buying Nvidia's semiconductors and using its data centers.

,"Favorable Supply/Demand Dynamics Supporting Bitcoin, Spot ETFs","This article was originally published on ETFTrends.com.

One of the widely cited catalysts pertaining to bitcoin is supply. Only 21 million of the digital coins can be mined. And thanks to quadrennial halvings, the next of which is slated for April, it gets harder to mine the cryptocurrency.

By some estimates, it could take more than a century for all bitcoins to be issued. It could be slightly longer or shorter, but the supply of bitcoin has a hard cap on it. That’s a longer-ranging supply/demand dynamic. But more recently, the largest cryptocurrency is benefiting from near-term supply/demand factors.

Notably, the spot bitcoin ETFs that debuted in the U.S. in January are actively gobbling up bitcoin. By some estimates, those ETFs are buying 3,500-4,300 bitcoins per day because investors are flocking to those funds.
Bitcoin ETFs Making Big Difference in Supply

In plain English, due to inflows into their ETFs, issuers of U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs have been regularly buying more bitcoin than is created on a daily basis. As David Hollerith of Yahoo Finance reports, the average number of bitcoins created in a day is 900.

Using the aforementioned 3,500-4,300 estimate, it’s clear that issuers of spot bitcoin ETFs are, in an average day, buying close to or more than quadruple the supply being created. On some days, their buying activity is close to 5x the number of new bitcoins issued. There are also other supply factors to consider.

“The US government currently holds 215,000 BTC, according to blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence, a stash that includes confiscations in various seizures such as from the 2016 hack of crypto exchange Bitfinex,” reported Hollerith.

That doesn’t even account for bitcoins lost forever because some users forgot passwords to digital wallets. That figure is estimated to be thousands of coins worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

Of course, Uncle Sam could eventually sell some of his bitcoin holdings. And ETF issuer almost certainly will, as some investors look to lock in profits. But the point is supply/demand scenarios are currently helping bitcoin. That could be the case again over the long term.

Some of the well-known spot bitcoin ETFs trading in the U.S. include the VanEck Bitcoin ETF Trust (HODL), Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO), WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), and the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB).","This article was originally published on ETFTrends.com.

,The Artificial Intelligence (AI) Market Could Soar 820% by 2030: 2 AI Growth Stocks to Buy Now and Hold Long-Term,"Artificial intelligence (AI) spending across hardware, software, and services totaled about $200 billion last year, according to Grand View Research. But that figure is expected to soar 820% to exceed $1.8 trillion by 2030. In other words, the AI market is forecast to compound at 37% annually through the end of the decade.

Many companies will benefit from that rising tide, but Cloudflare (NYSE: NET) and ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) stand out because they have strong footholds in relevant markets. Additionally, both stocks trade at reasonable valuations compared to Wall Street's growth expectations.

Here's what investors should know.
1. Cloudflare

Cloudflare operates a connectivity and security cloud. Its platform accelerates and protects software and infrastructure across private data centers and public cloud environments. The company also offers a developer platform that lets businesses tap its network to build and deploy websites and applications, and it's particularly focused on supporting inference for artificial intelligence applications.

Cloudflare has material advantages in speed and scale. Specifically, the company operates the fastest cloud network and developer platform on the market. It also handles about 20% of web traffic, which provides deep insight into performance problems and security threats across the internet. Cloudflare uses that data to continuously route traffic and stop threats more effectively.

Those qualities have helped the company achieve a strong position in several cloud services markets. For instance, International Data Corp. recently recognized its leadership in zero-trust network access, citing threat detection powered by machine learning models trained with prodigious amounts of internet traffic as a key strength. Additionally, Forrester Research recently recognized Cloudflare as a leader in edge development platforms, citing a better product and stronger growth strategy compared to peers.

Cloudflare reported excellent financial results in the fourth quarter. Customers increased 17% to 189,791, and the average customer spent 15% more. In turn, revenue rose 32% to $362 million, and non-GAAP (adjusted) net income soared 148% to $53 million. Additionally, management said close rates and average deal size improved markedly compared to the previous quarter, signaling an uptick in sales force productivity.

Going forward, Cloudflare is well positioned to benefit from AI, given its leadership among edge development platforms. Additionally, its network serves as a unified control plane across private data centers and public clouds, but vendors like Amazon and Microsoft do not offer the same support. Finally, Cloudflare has been outfitting its network with Nvidia GPUs optimized for AI inference.

Last year, CEO Matthew Prince said, ""By our estimates, Cloudflare is the most commonly used cloud provider across leading AI start-ups."" He also mentioned that the company was ""uniquely positioned to become a leader in AI inferencing.""

With that in mind, Wall Street expects Cloudflare to grow revenue at 25% annually over the next five years, but that estimate leaves room for upside if the company becomes a major player in AI inference. In that context, its current valuation of 24.7 times sales is tolerable. The stock may be volatile in the near term, but patient investors with a five-year time horizon should consider buying a small position today.
2. ServiceNow

ServiceNow helps businesses unify and digitize workflows across disparate systems. Specifically, its platform integrates with third-party applications from vendors like Microsoft and Atlassian to address four primary use cases: technology workflows like IT service, customer workflows like customer service, employee workflows like human resources, and creator workflows like application development and task automation.

ServiceNow is best known for its dominance in IT service and IT operations management. But industry analysts have also recognized its leadership in other software verticals, including artificial intelligence (AI) for IT operations, digital process automation, and low-code application development platforms.

The company reported solid fourth-quarter financial results. Revenue increased 26% to $2.4 billion, and non-GAAP net income jumped 36% to $3.11 per diluted share. In addition, the remaining performance obligation (contracted revenue that has not been recognized) climbed 29%, hinting at a possible acceleration in sales growth in the coming quarters. That momentum is due in part to the demand for generative AI.

ServiceNow was quick to capitalize on generative AI following the launch of ChatGPT. In fact, it was one of the first major software platforms to bring generative AI capabilities to its customers when it launched Now Assist last September. Now Assist brings the ability to create content, summarize information, and automate interactions to IT service, field service, customer service, and human resources teams.

However, innovation at ServiceNow extends beyond AI. The company launched finance and supply chain workflows last year that simplify and automate the sourcing and purchasing of goods and services. Those tools are particularly timely because modernizing enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems has become an IT focus area.

In short, ServiceNow has a strong presence in several IT software verticals. The company is growing quickly, and it's still bringing new products to market at a steady pace. Yet, ServiceNow has tapped a small portion of its $220 billion addressable market. That lays the foundation for strong sales growth for the foreseeable future.

Indeed, Wall Street expects the company to grow sales at 20% annually over the next five years. That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 16.9 times sales seem reasonable. Investors with a five-year time horizon should feel comfortable buying a small position in this growth stock today.

,"3 Reasons to Buy Bitcoin With $10,000","In typical fashion, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is, once again, rising from the ashes. Recently hitting a new all-time high of more than $69,000, the brutal crypto winter that lasted much of 2022 is now but a distant memory.

Despite doubling in just over four months, there is still plenty of reason to believe Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies in general, for that matter) has yet to hit its peak, presenting a valuable opportunity for investors. Here are three short- and long-term reasons I would buy Bitcoin with $10,000 today.

The upcoming halving

The most immediate and apparent reason Bitcoin is worth a $10,000 investment today is the upcoming halving. Roughly every four years, as 210,000 blocks  are added to the blockchain, Bitcoin's rewards for mining new coins is reduced in half.

There have been three halvings so far, and the fourth is set to occur in mid to late April. This halving will be especially unique because it will cause Bitcoin's inflation rate to fall under 1% for the first time.

Since the halving effectively makes Bitcoin more scarce, it has historically led to increases in price. During a year when a halving has occurred, Bitcoin has jumped by 125% on average. If a similar situation were to unfold this year, Bitcoin's price could reach roughly $99,000.

While past performance is no indicator of future results, it is difficult to dismiss the impact of the halving on Bitcoin's price. By reducing the rate of Bitcoin's production, the halving makes it so that even if demand remains constant, its price must increase to compensate for the lessened supply.
The perfect hedge to inflation

Now for a more long-term reason to invest in Bitcoin. While this year will see another halving, it is just one of many scheduled to take place. These halvings form the basis of Bitcoin's robust monetary policy and will continue until 2140, when the last Bitcoin is finally mined.

With a finite supply of only 21 million coins plus a diminishing inflation rate, Bitcoin has risen to become a viable hedge against inflation. And it will likely only become more capable of filling this role over time as the dollar's value continues to erode.

It can be slightly complex, but while inflation has dominated headlines over recent years, it isn't necessarily a new phenomenon. It is well known that policymakers and officials intentionally inflate fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar to supposedly stimulate the economy. Whether this is necessary for economic growth or not, I will leave it to the experts to decide.

What is clearer, though, is that any inflation reduces the buying power of currency holders, and it is nearly guaranteed that the dollar will lose value as time passes. Even if inflation is maintained at the targeted 2%, holders of these fiat currencies will see their purchasing power decrease by half in just 35 years.

In this regard, Bitcoin is the antithesis of fiat. Every dollar saved in Bitcoin is virtually immune to manipulation of central banks and governments. Not only is it protected, but since its inflation rate continues to diminish with each halving, and it has a finite supply of 21 million, any value stored in Bitcoin should grow with time.
The bona fide cryptocurrency

Bitcoin outperforms the dollar in several respects but is also superior to just about every other cryptocurrency. While many new cryptocurrencies parade functionality Bitcoin doesn't provide, such as the ability to buy non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or participate in decentralized finance (DeFi) activities, they all fall short when it comes to decentralization and security.

In terms of security, Bitcoin's vast global network is estimated to be 500 times more powerful than the best supercomputer. To put it simply, Bitcoin's blockchain is virtually impenetrable and unhackable.

Adding to its security, Bitcoin is also the most decentralized blockchain network. Analysts believe there are somewhere around 57,000 nodes maintaining the Bitcoin network scattered around the world. Unlike other cryptocurrencies with concentrated points of potential failure, Bitcoin epitomizes a truly decentralized network.

So, not only does it possess characteristics that make it the ultimate hedge against inflation, but it also possesses two of the most crucial aspects contributing to a cryptocurrency's value and long-term viability. Investors can rest assured knowing that any value stored in Bitcoin is safeguarded within the most secure and decentralized blockchain ever invented.

3 Reasons to Buy Bitcoin With $10,000 was originally published by The Motley Fool","In typical fashion, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is, once again, rising from the ashes. Recently hitting a new all-time high of more than $69,000, the brutal crypto winter that lasted much of 2022 is now but a distant memory.

Despite doubling in just over four months, there is still plenty of reason to believe Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies in general, for that matter) has yet to hit its peak, presenting a valuable opportunity for investors. Here are three short- and long-term reasons I would buy Bitcoin with $10,000 today.

The upcoming halving

The most immediate and apparent reason Bitcoin is worth a $10,000 investment today is the upcoming halving. Roughly every four years, as 210,000 blocks  are added to the blockchain, Bitcoin's rewards for mining new coins is reduced in half.

There have been three halvings so far, and the fourth is set to occur in mid to late April. This halving will be especially unique because it will cause Bitcoin's inflation rate to fall under 1% for the first time.

Since the halving effectively makes Bitcoin more scarce, it has historically led to increases in price. During a year when a halving has occurred, Bitcoin has jumped by 125% on average. If a similar situation were to unfold this year, Bitcoin's price could reach roughly $99,000.

While past performance is no indicator of future results, it is difficult to dismiss the impact of the halving on Bitcoin's price. By reducing the rate of Bitcoin's production, the halving makes it so that even if demand remains constant, its price must increase to compensate for the lessened supply.
The perfect hedge to inflation

Now for a more long-term reason to invest in Bitcoin. While this year will see another halving, it is just one of many scheduled to take place. These halvings form the basis of Bitcoin's robust monetary policy and will continue until 2140, when the last Bitcoin is finally mined.

With a finite supply of only 21 million coins plus a diminishing inflation rate, Bitcoin has risen to become a viable hedge against inflation. And it will likely only become more capable of filling this role over time as the dollar's value continues to erode.

It can be slightly complex, but while inflation has dominated headlines over recent years, it isn't necessarily a new phenomenon. It is well known that policymakers and officials intentionally inflate fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar to supposedly stimulate the economy.

,Cathie Wood’s New Price Target for Bitcoin “Well Above” $1M,"Cathie Wood, CEO of the investment firm ARK Invest, has significantly increased her bullish outlook on Bitcoin's price trajectory. In a recent interview, she revealed that ARK has ""brought forward"" its previous $1 million price target for Bitcoin by 2030. Wood attributes this shift to the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. The surge in interest and investment potential unlocked by these ETFs has prompted ARK to re-evaluate Bitcoin's future.

""That target...it was before the SEC gave us the green light,"" Wood explained, referring to the Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. ""And I think that was a major milestone, and it has pulled forward the timeline.""

While Bitcoin has already seen significant price appreciation, Wood believes the party is just getting started. Major financial institutions, like Morgan Stanley or Bank of America, have yet to fully embrace Bitcoin, according to Wood. ""No platform has approved Bitcoin yet,"" she said. ""So all of this price action has happened before they approve it, and so we haven't even begun.""

This lack of mainstream institutional involvement suggests even more significant price increases are on the horizon. Wood hinted at a revised price target ""well above"" $1 million by 2030, but declined to provide a specific figure.","Cathie Wood, CEO of the investment firm ARK Invest, has significantly increased her bullish outlook on Bitcoin's price trajectory.

,"1 Top Cryptocurrency to Buy Before It Soars 2,139%, According to Cathie Wood","Ark Invest's Cathie Wood is a big believer in Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC). She launched Ark's first spot price Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in January once regulators gave their approval.

Earlier this year, Wood raised her price target from $1 million to $1.5 million by 2027 -- which would represent a whopping 2,139% jump from Bitcoin's recent price of about $67,000. Wood expects that explosive growth to be driven by three tailwinds: the approvals of Bitcoin ETFs, institutional purchases of those ETFs, and the expected halving next month, which will cut the rewards for mining Bitcoin in half.

We should take those estimates with a grain of salt, since Wood has a habit of making wildly bullish predictions and not necessarily delivering; her flagship Ark Innovation ETF, for example, has only risen 13% over the past five years as the S&P 500 rallied 88%. That said, we should still consider whether Wood's bullish thesis makes sense and if Bitcoin is worth buying.
The bull case for Bitcoin

The bulls believe Bitcoin will eventually join gold, silver, and other precious metals as a hedge against long-term inflation. Like the gold bugs, Bitcoin's bulls believe that fiat currencies are destined to depreciate, and the trend will drive more governments, businesses, and investors to adopt the cryptocurrency. Up until this January, most of those people invested in Bitcoin in three ways: through direct purchases on a crypto exchange like Coinbase, through a trust like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, and through ETFs that were pinned to Bitcoin futures.

But all three methods had drawbacks. Crypto exchanges were disconnected from the public stock exchanges, prone to sudden disruptions and outages, and frequently targeted by regulators. The collapse of FTX and the recent criminal charges against Binance also rattled investors' confidence in stand-alone cryptocurrency exchanges.

Crypto trusts were more secure and could be actively traded on the stock market, but they charged high fees. Bitcoin future ETFs also charged high fees, but they often failed to keep pace with the cryptocurrency's actual spot prices. The Securities and Exchange Commission's approvals in January of the first 11 spot price Bitcoin ETFs resolved those issues; the ETFs charge low fees, are directly tied to Bitcoin's spot price, and can be easily traded on the open market.

Wood believes those new ETFs will drive institutional investors to buy more Bitcoin. Back in December 2021, Wood predicted that if institutional investors allocated an average of 5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, it would boost its near-term price by about $500,000. Wood reiterated that bullish view earlier this month and said that institutional buyers would drive Bitcoin's price to $1.5 million as it's recognized as a new asset class.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin will undergo its next halving in April. That process, which occurs every four years, cuts in half the reward for miners like Marathon Digital to mint new Bitcoin -- but it might help boost Bitcoin's price as market demand outstrips its slowing supply growth.

At the same time, persistent inflation and escalating geopolitical conflicts could drive more countries to adopt Bitcoin as a mainstream currency. That trend could accelerate Bitcoin's transformation into a reliable, safe asset like gold and silver.
But is Bitcoin really headed to $1.5 million?

Cathie Wood isn't alone in her bullish view for Bitcoin's future. The British bank Standard Chartered says its price will hit $100,000 by the end of 2024, while the financial services giant Fidelity predicts its price will reach $100 million by 2035 and $1 billion by 2038. It's impossible to say if those predictions will come true, but the approvals of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs could set a floor under its volatile price.

So instead of wondering if Bitcoin will deliver a 2,000% gain in just three years, investors should simply ask themselves if they believe the bullish argument. If Bitcoin sounds like a promising investment, then it might be smart to accumulate some Bitcoin or shares of a low-fee spot price ETF as a long-term growth play.

,"Cryptocurrencies Are Soaring, But I Think This Is the Best Buy Right Now","If you've been keeping up on markets, you've likely seen that cryptocurrencies are back in full force. In just 2024 alone, the asset class has jumped by nearly 50%, collectively worth more than $2.45 trillion today.

However, despite this resurgence, many indicators suggest that crypto has yet to hit its peak, making today a valuable opportunity. While combing through the thousands of cryptocurrencies in circulation can be a daunting task, there is a simpler way for investors to ride the waves of crypto's momentum, and it's not even a cryptocurrency -- it's Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN).

Some context first

As the first crypto native company to go public, Coinbase's stock market debut was lauded as a significant achievement in the legitimization of digital assets. However, that was almost three years ago, when crypto was at the peak of its last bull market. Since then, much has changed.

After the euphoria of the bull market faded, a brutal crypto winter ensued and dealt a catastrophic blow to Coinbase. In the depths of the crypto winter, Coinbase posted an annual loss of $2.6 billion in 2022, a far cry from 2021 when it raked in more than $3.6 billion in profits.

To its credit, as bad as the bear market was, Coinbase weathered the storm and has since risen to become an even better company. With a revamped business model, fresh international expansion strategy, and prioritization of innovation, as crypto begins to prepare for a new bull market, Coinbase's best days remain ahead.
A new Coinbase takes shape

The most glaring difference between the old Coinbase and the new Coinbase is its diversified revenue model. When crypto prices plunged in 2022, Coinbase's sole reliance on transaction fees as revenue meant that when activity on its platform dried up, so did profits.

As a testament to CEO Brian Armstrong's vision and leadership, he recognized this and steered the company in a different direction. While profits were hard to come by for all of 2022 and most of 2023, during this time Coinbase was busy building an entirely new business model.

As evidence of this transformation, consider that transaction fees make up less than half of total revenue today, a significant improvement from when they accounted for 90% of revenue a few years ago.

Coinbase's Subscription and Services segment is picking up the slack. Comprised of products such as staking rewards, stablecoin interest, and custodial fees, Subscription and Services now contributes to the bulk of revenue.

Adding to the company's transformation, Coinbase implemented an international expansion strategy in the beginning of 2023. So far, it's safe to say it's been a resounding success. With this expansion, Coinbase launched an international derivative exchange, set up European headquarters in Ireland, and grew operations to more than 100 countries.

To round out Coinbase's evolution, we can't forget about its embrace of innovation. In August 2023, Coinbase launched its very own proprietary blockchain, Base. While it's still in its early days, Base is proving that it will be a valuable asset moving forward, as it has undergone explosive growth.

In just six months, Base's total users surpassed 3 million, and its decentralized finance (DeFi) economy blossomed from just $8.5 million to more than $560 million. In that same time, the blockchain has produced more than $6 million in profits for Coinbase.
Quantifying the opportunity

By all accounts, Coinbase is firing on all cylinders. Consider that fourth-quarter 2023 was the first profitable quarter in almost two years as proof.

Here lies the opportunity for investors. As the prospect of a historic bull market looms, its diversified business model could launch the company into territory it hasn't seen.

So, rather than trying to comb through the thousands of cryptocurrencies on the market, why not own the company that relies on the market as a whole? From this angle, Coinbase effectively becomes a proxy to gain exposure to the best of the crypto asset class.

As impressive as Coinbase's turnaround was, it still trades at roughly 30% below its all-time high. Accounting for the fact that it is a far better company than when it was trading for $345, plus the added benefit of a crypto bull market, the potential upside of Coinbase is difficult to quantify. Don't be surprised if Coinbase ends up outperforming many cryptocurrencies in the coming months.

Cryptocurrencies Are Soaring, But I Think This Is the Best Buy Right Now was originally published by The Motley Fool","If you've been keeping up on markets, you've likely seen that cryptocurrencies are back in full force. In just 2024 alone, the asset class has jumped by nearly 50%, collectively worth more than $2.45 trillion today.

However, despite this resurgence, many indicators suggest that crypto has yet to hit its peak, making today a valuable opportunity. While combing through the thousands of cryptocurrencies in circulation can be a daunting task, there is a simpler way for investors to ride the waves of crypto's momentum, and it's not even a cryptocurrency -- it's Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN).

Some context first

As the first crypto native company to go public, Coinbase's stock market debut was lauded as a significant achievement in the legitimization of digital assets. However, that was almost three years ago, when crypto was at the peak of its last bull market. Since then, much has changed.

After the euphoria of the bull market faded, a brutal crypto winter ensued and dealt a catastrophic blow to Coinbase. In the depths of the crypto winter, Coinbase posted an annual loss of $2.6 billion in 2022, a far cry from 2021 when it raked in more than $3.6 billion in profits.

To its credit, as bad as the bear market was, Coinbase weathered the storm and has since risen to become an even better company. With a revamped business model, fresh international expansion strategy, and prioritization of innovation, as crypto begins to prepare for a new bull market, Coinbase's best days remain ahead.
A new Coinbase takes shape

The most glaring difference between the old Coinbase and the new Coinbase is its diversified revenue model. When crypto prices plunged in 2022, Coinbase's sole reliance on transaction fees as revenue meant that when activity on its platform dried up, so did profits.

As a testament to CEO Brian Armstrong's vision and leadership, he recognized this and steered the company in a different direction. While profits were hard to come by for all of 2022 and most of 2023, during this time Coinbase was busy building an entirely new business model.

As evidence of this transformation, consider that transaction fees make up less than half of total revenue today, a significant improvement from when they accounted for 90% of revenue a few years ago.

Coinbase's Subscription and Services segment is picking up the slack. Comprised of products such as staking rewards, stablecoin interest, and custodial fees, Subscription and Services now contributes to the bulk of revenue.

Adding to the company's transformation, Coinbase implemented an international expansion strategy in the beginning of 2023. So far, it's safe to say it's been a resounding success. With this expansion, Coinbase launched an international derivative exchange, set up European headquarters in Ireland, and grew operations to more than 100 countries.

To round out Coinbase's evolution, we can't forget about its embrace of innovation. In August 2023, Coinbase launched its very own proprietary blockchain, Base. While it's still in its early days, Base is proving that it will be a valuable asset moving forward, as it has undergone explosive growth.

In just six months, Base's total users surpassed 3 million, and its decentralized finance (DeFi) economy blossomed from just $8.5 million to more than $560 million. In that same time, the blockchain has produced more than $6 million in profits for Coinbase.
Quantifying the opportunity

By all accounts, Coinbase is firing on all cylinders. Consider that fourth-quarter 2023 was the first profitable quarter in almost two years as proof.

Here lies the opportunity for investors. As the prospect of a historic bull market looms, its diversified business model could launch the company into territory it hasn't seen.

So, rather than trying to comb through the thousands of cryptocurrencies on the market, why not own the company that relies on the market as a whole? From this angle, Coinbase effectively becomes a proxy to gain exposure to the best of the crypto asset class.

As impressive as Coinbase's turnaround was, it still trades at roughly 30% below its all-time high. Accounting for the fact that it is a far better company than when it was trading for $345, plus the added benefit of a crypto bull market, the potential upside of Coinbase is difficult to quantify. Don't be surprised if Coinbase ends up outperforming many cryptocurrencies in the coming months.

,"MicroStrategy Buys 12,000 More Bitcoin for $821.7 Million","(Bloomberg) — MicroStrategy Inc. bought another 12,000 Bitcoin for $821.7 million, the second-largest purchase by the enterprise-software maker since it began acquiring the cryptocurrency almost four years ago.

The fresh hoard raised MicroStrategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to around 205,000 tokens, or to more than $14 billion. The tokens were bought from Feb. 26 through March 10, according to a US Securities and Exchange Commission filing by the Tysons Corner, Virginia-based company. The Bitcoin was acquired mostly with the proceeds from the sale of $800 million of convertible notes through a private sale that was completed March 8.

Michael Saylor, the chairman and co-founder of MicroStrategy, started buying Bitcoin in 2020 as an inflation hedge and alternative to holding cash. MicroStrategy has already spent more than $1 billion in Bitcoin in the first three months of 2024, more than half of last year’s total buying. The cryptocurrency is up around 675% since Saylor began buying.

The shift into Bitcoin has led to a revival in the share price of MicroStrategy, which has surged more than 1,000% since Saylor’s pivot. The company’s market capitalization has increase to around $25.7 billion, topping the level that it previously peaked at in March 2000. MicroStrategy reached a settlement in December 2000 with the SEC over accounting fraud allegations.

The average price for the latest acquisition of Bitcoin was $68,477, while the average price for the total holding is $33,706, according to the filing. Bitcoin reached a record high of more than $72,000 on Monday.

Shares of MicroStrategy rose 6.6% to $1,513.46 as of 9:33 a.m. in New York.

,"First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Surpasses $71K, Reaches All-Time High","Top Stories

Bitcoin (BTC) moved past $71,000 during the Asian hours, setting a new lifetime high. The leading cryptocurrency has been steadily rising since the approval of the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S. The token crossed $70,000 for the first time ever last week. Ether (ETH) also crossed $4,000 on Monday. Meanwhile, the broader CoinDesk 20 index (CD20) jumped nearly 1%. The rally has lifted the annualized three-month futures premium on major exchanges, including Binance, to above 25%. The elevated premium could attract cash and carry traders, boosting market liquidity.

Rising bitcoin prices have revived a crypto trading frenzy in South Korea, with volumes on local exchanges crossing those in the local stock market last week. Local media reported that trading volumes on South Korea-based crypto exchanges totaled a record 11.8 trillion won (KRW) on Sunday, or $9 billion at the going USD-KRW exchange rate. These topped Friday’s South Korean stock trading volume of 11.47 trillion won, or $8.7 billion. This figure is the combined transaction amount of Korea’s five largest won markets, including Upbit (8.8 trillion won), Bithumb (2.7 trillion won), Coinone (176.4 billion won), Gopax (55.2 billion won), and Coinone (32 billion won).

Indian cryptocurrency investment platform Mudrex plans to offer U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to institutional and retail investors in India, CEO and co-founder Edul Patel said. “This is much more valuable to institutions, as this was already available to retailers,” Patel said in an interview with CoinDesk. Retail clients in the country could access spot-bitcoin ETFs through U.S. stock investing companies, but “as far as we know,” we are the first in India to offer this service to institutions, Patel said. “We are certainly the first Indian crypto platform to offer this service.” In the first phase, Mudrex will list four spot ETFs – BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton and Vanguard.

,4 Crypto Stocks to Watch as Bitcoin Rallies to All-Time High,"There’s no stopping the Bitcoin (BTC) rally as the world’s most popular cryptocurrency topped the $70,000 mark for the first time on Mar 8 to hit an all-time high. Although it remained above $70,000 briefly before hovering around $69,350, Bitcoin has maintained its all-time high and is poised to rally further.

The recent rally is being driven by a surge in demand for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and optimism surrounding the likely drop in interest rates globally in the near term.

The approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in early January has played a pivotal role in boosting the broader cryptocurrency market.

The green light to the spot Bitcoin ETF was given with the aim of integrating cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance and providing consistent backing to the crypto sector in the foreseeable future. The move has been bearing fruit as billions of dollars have flowed into ETFs over the past two months.

The market is receiving additional support from a perspective that involves an upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain platform, which is the home of the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ether.

The optimism surrounding Bitcoin has spilled over to other major cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE). Ethereum was last hovering around $3,893, while Dogecoin was trading at $0.17.

Another reason behind the ongoing rally is the upcoming Bitcoin halving event scheduled for April, which will cut the mining reward for new blocks in half. Historically, this occurrence has intensified scarcity, posing a challenge for miners to generate a net increase in Bitcoins. Traditionally, Bitcoin's value tends to rise during these periods of restricted supply.

,Donald Trump Sounds More Constructive on Bitcoin,"Former U.S. president Donald Trump continued to come around on Bitcoin {{BTC}}, calling it an ""additional form of currency"" in a CNBC appearance.

""There has been a lot of use of that [bitcoin] and I'm not sure that i would want to take it away at this point,"" he added. The comments represent a stark change in stance from 2021 when Trump labelled bitcoin as a ""scam"" that threatened the U.S. Dollar as the world reserve currency.

Trump's comments this morning follow remarks he made last month when he said bitcoin had ""taken on a life of its own"" and that it will probably need regulation.

To be sure, the GOP standard bearer for the 2024 presidential election is a long way from becoming a Bitcoin maxi or showing anything other than a passing interest in the crypto. ""I want one currency, I want the dollar, I don't want people leaving the dollar,"" he continued, before moving on talking about the great interest shown in some of his NFT offerings. ""People were going crazy for these things [NFTs], and so many of these were bought with this new cryptocurrency and I couldn't believe the amount,"" he said.

Trump added that he ""would not allow countries to go off the dollar"" because when the U.S. loses that standard it will ""be like losing a revolutionary war.""

Trump has regularly been posting screenshots of his bullish odds on Polymarket, a crypto-based prediction market.

To be sure, the GOP standard bearer for the 2024 presidential election is a long way from becoming a Bitcoin maxi or showing anything other than a passing interest in the crypto. ""I want one currency, I want the dollar, I don't want people leaving the dollar,"" he continued, before moving on talking about the great interest shown in some of his NFT offerings. ""People were going crazy for these things [NFTs], and so many of these were bought with this new cryptocurrency and I couldn't believe the amount,"" he said.

Trump added that he ""would not allow countries to go off the dollar"" because when the U.S. loses that standard it will ""be like losing a revolutionary war.""

Trump has regularly been posting screenshots of his bullish odds on Polymarket, a crypto-based prediction market.

UPDATE March 11, 2024 (13:57 UTC): Add Trump's quote on not allowing countries to leave the dollar.","‘There has been a lot of use of that [Bitcoin] and I`m not sure that I would want to take it away at this point,‘‘ he added.

,"BlockFi’s Zac Prince Leaves Crypto, Joins Real Estate Tech Startup Re Cost Seg","    Zac Prince will join Re Cost Seg, which provides cost segregation studies for real estate investors.

    Prince said there were plenty of lessons learned during BlockFi’s better days that he can apply to Re Cost Seg.

As BlockFi settles with the estates of FTX and Alameda Research, which could lead to a full recovery for the bankrupt crypto lender’s users, Zac Prince, BlockFi founder and now former CEO, is leaving the company and crypto altogether for a real estate tech startup called Re Cost Seg.

“I considered starting another crypto company after my time at BlockFi. I’m passionate about the space and believe in it as much as when I started BlockFi,” Prince told CoinDesk in an interview. “However, my wife advised against it due to the craziness and volatility of the crypto industry. She suggested I do something less high-octane.”

So Prince has landed at Re Cost Seg, an opportunity he heard about via X. Re Cost Seg provides cost segregation studies for real estate investors, enabling them to accelerate property depreciation and save money on taxes.

Usually, these types of services are only available to large institutional-size landlords due to their cost, making them out of reach to the “Mom and Pop” scale landlords, which make up 70% of the residential rental owners in the U.S. according to data from the National Association of Realtors.

“This company is democratizing access to these cost segregation studies,” Prince said, adding that there were similarities to how BlockFi provided a tax-efficient way to use crypto proceeds. “Our products will save you money on taxes like nobody wants to pay more taxes. Everybody loves saving money on taxes.”

Prince said there were plenty of lessons learned during BlockFi’s better days that he can apply to Re Cost Seg, like the importance of customer service.

“We were the first company in the crypto lending category to have a phone number that people could call,” he said.

Prince also said there’s a fast and furious development cycle in crypto that he wants to bring to the TradFi real estate space.

“In five years, we launched four consumer-facing products and an institutional platform, along with internal tools and processes for efficient product development,” he said.

“In marketing, crypto is unique with its 24/7 media cycle, so learning to navigate that and developing strategies, such as partnering with big podcasters, was key,” he continued. I also learned a lot about team building; we had a phenomenal team at BlockFi, many of whom are staying in the crypto industry, and some have even started new crypto companies, which makes me proud.”
The last one out of BlockFi

Even though Prince has moved on from BlockFi, he says his crypto will remain on the platform until all of the lender’s former clients have been made whole.

“As part of our bankruptcy process, I always kept all of my crypto at BlockFi. I said I’d give up any recovery rights to my crypto until BlockFi clients get 100% back,” he said.

Prince explained during the interview that BlockFi went bankrupt because FTX and its affiliates were lent money –this arrangement was fully disclosed in BlockFi’s terms and conditions – and didn’t pay it back, something he also said on the stand during Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial.

“At the beginning of our bankruptcy, the lawyers for FTX took a hostile position, claiming BlockFi owed them money, which we found absurd since FTX and its affiliates owed us money,” he said. “It’s validating to see the outcome in BlockFi’s favor, and the impact on client recoveries is significant.”

In a post on X, Prince said there were many things he would have done differently or changed in hindsight, but the most significant was BlockFi’s relationship with FTX.

“I testified at the SBF trial, which was helpful in terms of enabling justice through a guilty verdict, but the real goal and focus for me (and the remaining BlockFi team) was and remains to return as much value to clients as possible,” he wrote in the post.

For a while, BlockFi’s clients were made entirely whole, and it didn’t seem like a realistic conclusion to the bankruptcy process. In January 2023, during the dark days of crypto winter, bankruptcy claims for BlockFi were trading at 30 cents on the dollar.

“The people that bought the bankruptcy claims made a killing,” Prince concluded.","    Zac Prince will join Re Cost Seg, which provides cost segregation studies for real estate investors.

,"Bitcoin’s newest all-time high of $72,700 doesn’t mean high prices are here to stay forever","The crypto scene continues to remain so hot that bitcoin is hitting one new high after another. It surpassed $72,700 on Monday. This was initially driven by the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, but is now being pushed higher ahead of a “halving” event, which will limit the amount of new supply put into circulation from bitcoin miners.

Bitcoin has increased 9.5% in the past seven days and is up 50% on the month, according to CoinMarketCap data. The total crypto market cap across all tokens has increased 10% on the week to $2.71 trillion, with bitcoin making up 52.7% of that amount.

There is, of course, no way of telling how high bitcoin can rise during the current bull frenzy. While many are feeling the hopium, there’s at least one indicator that thinks we’re nearing the top of the highs, with price dips to quickly follow.

The CoinMarketCap Crypto Fear & Greed Index is in “extreme greed” territory at 89.12 points, up from “neutral” at 59.3 points, in early February. The index measures price and trading data of the biggest cryptocurrencies, with its user behavior data to measure crypto market sentiment from 0-100. When the index is closer to zero, investors have over-sold their positions “irrationally,” compared to when the value is closer to 100, the market is likely to face a correction.

With that said, bitcoin has remained the main focus for retail and institutional investors, with $2.6 billion inflows on the week, aka money being put into the asset, and $9.9 billion year-to-date, according to CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report. Ether, the second largest cryptocurrency, isn’t benefiting directly from any bitcoin enthusiasm hype. Its inflows this past week are down $2.1 million, although it is up $135 million year-to-date.

CoinShares Volume 173: Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report

Regardless of how high investors will push bitcoin up ahead of the bitcoin halving event, which is expected to transpire in mid-April and happens every four years, there’s no reason to believe that what goes up won’t come down. Again. In previous cycles, bitcoin halvings increased demand and pricing for the cryptocurrency.

The last bitcoin halving was on May 11, 2020 and drove its price up about 600% from around $9,000 to $63,000 by the April 2021 mark. Then it fell about 50% within three months, signaling renewed volatility for the asset.","The crypto scene continues to remain so hot that bitcoin is hitting one new high after another.

,Islamic State Is Increasingly Using Crypto to Fund Africa Militant Goals,"(Bloomberg) -- Islamic State is increasingly using cryptocurrencies such as Tether to raise and move money around the world, including in Africa, according to a group of nations formed to combat financing for the militant group.

While IS still mostly relies on informal money services such as cash couriers, affiliates including in West Africa are making payments using virtual assets, the Counter ISIS Finance Group said in a fact sheet posted on the US Treasury’s website.

IS no longer holds the swathes of Syria and Iraq it controlled a decade ago, but offshoots, especially in Africa, continue to wage violent campaigns. The group has access to an estimated $10 million to $20 million in cash and other liquid assets, according to the fact sheet, though this is down from a peak of hundreds of millions of dollars.

The militants’ Somalia branch has been their primary revenue generator, earning about $6 million from extortion and local taxes.

The US last year reached $4.4 billion of settlement agreements with Binance Holdings Ltd., which operates the world’s biggest crypto exchange, for failing to take basic anti-money laundering steps to prevent the activities of terror organizations including IS.

Tether uses public blockchains that make it possible to track each transaction, the company said.

“With Tether, every action is online, every action is traceable, every asset can be seized and every criminal can be caught,” the operating company said in response to emailed questions. “We work with law enforcement to do exactly that.”

The US together with nations including Italy and Saudi Arabia make up the Counter ISIS Finance Group.

,Bitcoin CME Futures' Open Interest Reaches Record High of $10B,"    The notional open interest in CME’s bitcoin futures has risen past the $10 billion market for the first time.

    CME's futures market is now bigger than the market cap of litecoin, bitcoin cash and other top 25 cryptocurrencies.

The Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s (CME) bitcoin {{BTC}} futures market is busier than ever.

On Friday, a record 28,899 standard futures contracts were open or active on the CME. That amounts to a notional open interest of $10.3 billion at bitcoin’s going market rate of around $71,500. The standard contract, sized at 5 BTC, is widely considered a proxy for institutional activity.

Meanwhile, open interest in micro futures, sized at one-tenth of 1 BTC, stood at 38,283, which equates to $273 million in notional terms.

The combined open interest of over $10 billion is twice as large as the peak of $5.2 billion registered during the 2021 bull market and bigger than the market capitalization of several top 25 cryptocurrencies like litecoin, bitcoin cash, and others.

An uptick in open interest alongside a price rise is said to confirm the uptrend. Bitcoin has rallied 70% this year and the bullish mood is also evident from the 15% annualized premium in futures relative to spot prices.

CME's regulated and cash-settled futures have long been a preferred venue for institutions and other market participants looking to gain exposure to cryptocurrency without owning it. Besides, authorized participants tied to U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) likely trade CME futures or CME futures-based ETFs to hedge their risks.

The CFTC-regulated exchange steadily climbed ranks last year to become the world's largest futures exchange in a pattern reminiscent of the 2020-21 bull run.","    The notional open interest in CME’s bitcoin futures has risen past the $10 billion market for the first time.

,"Bitcoin’s Market Cap Jumps to $1.4T, Surpassing Silver","Bitcoin continues to rise in the ranks of top assets by market cap, pushing past silver to become the world's eighth most valuable property.

With a 4% advance to an all-time high past $72,000 in the morning hours of U.S. trading, bitcoin's {{BTC}} valuation shot to $1.42T, above that of sliver at $1.387T, according to CompaniesMarketCap.

Earlier in this historic bull run, bitcoin pushed ahead of the market cap of Meta (formerly known as Facebook), which now stands at $1.2 trillion.

Next up in bitcoin's sight is the globe's seventh most valuable asset, Google parent Alphabet, whose current valuation is just shy of $1.7 trillion. Some bitcoin bulls have their sights set on the world's most valuable property – gold and its $14.7 trillion market cap. To get there, bitcoin would have to rise more than 10-fold, or past $720,000 per token.

S. trading, bitcoin's {{BTC}} valuation shot to $1. Earlier in this historic bull run, bitcoin pushed ahead of the market cap of Meta (formerly known as Facebook), which now stands at $1. Next up in Bitcoin's sight is the globe's seventh most valuable asset, Google parent Alphabet, whose current valuation is just shy of $1. Some bitcoin bulls have their sights set on the world's most valuable property – gold and its $14.7 trillion market cap. To get there, bitcoin would have to rise more than 10-fold, or past $720,000 per token.

,Risk Appetite in Bitcoin Spurs ‘Enormous’ Leveraged ETF Flows,"(Bloomberg) -- Demand for the investment vehicles that offer leveraged exposure to Bitcoin is soaring as the digital asset hits record highs.

Leveraged futures-based exchange-traded funds such as VolatilityShares’ 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX) are seeing flows rivaling spot Bitcoin ETFs. The fund raked in $630 million in net monthly inflows, beaten only by BlackRock and Fidelity, according to data compiled by K33 Research.

Futures-based Bitcoin ETFs currently hold an all-time high equivalent exposure of 83,300 tokens and leveraged Bitcoin ETFs represent nearly 25% of the open interest on CME, which is one of the largest marketplaces for crypto derivatives. Futures premiums on the platform have climbed toward 20% amid record-high open interest, K33 said.

“The massive uptick in flows to 2x leveraged BTC ETFs illustrates the huge demand for leveraged long exposure in BTC of late and is consistent with the increased risk appetite witnessed in BTC derivatives,” according to a note on Tuesday. “Enormous inflows” to the fund are the main catalyst for the surge in open interest on CME.

VolatilityShares’ 2x fund currently holds a Bitcoin equivalent exposure of 36,025 tokens after more than doubling the crypto currency under management 11 days into March, K33 data show.

The increasing interest in such funds has prompted a flurry of new offerings. ProShares is expected to launch five leveraged long and short BTC ETFs within the next month to cater to new market demand and Valkyrie recently launched its 2x leveraged product.

The rise of such funds comes as an influx of investors seek a variety of channels to make leveraged bets on the latest bull run in the crypto market. The US-based institutions tend to use regulated offerings such as crypto futures on CME and spot ETFs from traditional asset managers, while offshore entities turn to the options contracts on Deribit and perpetual futures without an expiration date on Binance, which are among the most popular products for crypto traders.

The funding rates for Bitcoin perpetual futures — a key indicator for leverage in crypto — remain elevated across major offshore exchanges, with Deribit, the leading crypto options trading platform, seeing record open interest and a surge in bullish bets on Bitcoin.

“Perps continue to highlight an immense risk appetite in the market, with funding rates staying exorbitant while open interest fluctuates vividly,” the note said.

,"Bitcoin Breaks All-Time Highs, Elon Musk's Tesla And SpaceX In Major Profit","The crypto wallets of Elon Musk's companies have been located, according to blockchain analytics company Arkham Intelligence. Arkham cross-referenced financial reports with on-chain activity to locate the massive wallets.

Tesla Inc. and SpaceX have a combined total of around 19,800 Bitcoins, according to Arkham. The stash is divided across many wallets: Tesla holds around 11,500 BTC across 68 addresses, while SpaceX holds around 8,300 tokens across 28 wallets.

Don't Miss:

    If you invested $100 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here’s how much you’d have today.

    Bitcoin has jumped another 45% already this year – how much would you need to get started today?

The tokens are worth over $1.4 billion after Bitcoin reached new all-time highs and crossed above the $72,000 level.

This stash presents a major profit for the companies. SpaceX is at $276 million in profits on the investment, while Tesla has nearly $500 million in gains. While these amounts are small in comparison to the companies' profits from operations, they are sizable when compared to other investments.

Tesla began buying Bitcoin in February 2021, making an unprecedented investment of $1.5 billion in the token. This was a contributing factor to the Bitcoin rally seen less than a month later, where Bitcoin set all-time highs.

While Tesla has seen huge returns on its Bitcoin investment, it made some untimely sales. For example, it sold nearly 30,000 Bitcoins in June 2022, as the company needed cash and Musk wanted to show Bitcoin's ability to handle large transactions. Bitcoin was trading for around $25,000 at the time of the sale, well below current prices.

Trending: Large boom in cryptocurrency and metaverse interest as BTC skyrockets — has Apple Vision Pro increased the demand for virtual real estate?

Conversely, it sold around 10% of its total holdings after Bitcoin reached new all-time highs of over $60,000 in March 2021. The sale of 4,320 Bitcoins generated over $250 million in cash.

Musk and Tesla began accepting Bitcoin in early 2021, around the same time they made the initial investment of $1.5 billion. However, in May 2021, Musk discontinued purchases of Tesla vehicles with Bitcoin.

""Tesla has suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin. We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel. Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at great cost to the environment.""

So, Musk is a strong believer in crypto, but he does not see a way to use tokens that use lots of power and are potentially damaging to the environment. Bitcoin is proof-of-work (PoW), meaning that it allows network participants to use computing power to compete for the ability to process transactions. This results in huge amounts of energy consumption.

While Musk may not may not be using Bitcoin in a transactional way, it has certainly paid off as an investment.

,Donald Trump Says He Would Not Crack Down On Bitcoin Or Crypto If Elected President,"Earlier this week, former president Donald Trump went on CNBC to discuss Bitcoin and other related topics. Among the major points were a new regulatory stance from the presidential candidate, as well as some interesting developments from his recent line of Trump Sneakers.

In terms of regulation, Trump has not always been a fan of Bitcoin. In 2021, he said that Bitcoin was a ""disaster waiting to happen"" and that he was ""not a fan."" His stance has changed since then, likely because of the dominance of Bitcoin and ongoing discussions with former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who is in favor of crypto.

Don't Miss:

    If you invested $100 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here’s how much you’d have today.

    Bitcoin has jumped nearly 50% already this year – how much would you need to get started today?

According to Trump, ""Bitcoin has taken on a life of its own"" and has amassed a ton of popularity. Taking this into account, Trump said that if he were elected president, he would likely not impose new regulations on cryptocurrency.

""I have seen there has been a lot of use of that, and I'm not sure that I'd want to take it away at this point ... I can live with it one way or the other,"" Trump said.

This is an important stance for the presumptive Republican nominee, as it could have huge implications for crypto come November. If Trump wins the election in several months, crypto enthusiasts would not have to worry as much about the possibility of regulation. This could potentially work to the benefit of crypto as a whole.

Trump also discussed his recent line of Trump Sneakers, which he unveiled at Sneaker Con in Philadelphia. The set of 1,000 Never Surrender High-Tops sold for $399 per pair. However, more notable for crypto fans was Trump's discussion of payment methods that could be used to buy the shoes. ""Sometimes we’ll let people pay through Bitcoin ... it’s an additional form of currency ... so many [of the sneakers] were paid for with the ... cryptocurrency,"" Trump said.

This was a significant acknowledgment from Trump, who was against Bitcoin less than three years ago. Not only is Trump able to ""live with it one way or the other,"" but he is also willing to accept the token as payment. On top of that, the option to pay with Bitcoin was used for a decent amount of time, according to Trump.

While Bitcoin was meant to be used as a transactional digital currency, don't expect it to overtake the U.S. dollar under a Trump presidency. ""I always liked one currency. I call it a currency. I like the dollar.""

So, with the former president and presidential candidate more open to Bitcoin, it will be interesting to see how his stance continues to evolve before the November election.

,Grayscale Plans New Bitcoin Fund as GBTC Sheds Billions,"(Bloomberg) -- Grayscale Investments LLC intends to launch a clone of the world’s biggest Bitcoin fund as it loses billions to lower-cost rivals.

The asset manager submitted plans for the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust, which would be physically backed by the cryptocurrency and trade under the ticker ‘BTC,’ a Tuesday filing showed.

If approved, the exchange-traded fund would be seeded with an unspecified percentage of the world’s biggest Bitcoin ETF, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), and existing GBTC shareholders would automatically have shares of both GBTC and BTC without creating a taxable event, according to the filing.

Grayscale’s BTC plans land as investors continue to pull cash from the $28 billion GBTC, which has posted outflows of more than $11 billion — the second-most among more than 3,400 US-listed ETFs — so far this year. Investors have instead sent cash to its cheaper rivals, the bulk of which charge 0.3%, while GBTC charges 1.5% annually.

Separately, VanEck announced Tuesday that it was waiving the fee on the VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL) for the first $1.5 billion in assets until March 31, 2025.

Fees for BTC aren’t yet listed, but are expected to be lower than GBTC, according to a person familiar with the matter. ETF issuers State Street Global Advisors and Invesco Ltd have both launched cheaper versions of some of their biggest ETFs.

State Street introduced the $6.8 billion SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust (GLDM) in 2018 with a 0.1% fee, undercutting the 0.4% expense ratio of the older, larger SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). Invesco went a similar route with the 2020 launch of the $22.5 billion Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQM), which charges 0.15% annually versus the 0.2% fee on the $251 billion Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ).

The fresh highs were reached in the wake of a report from CoinShares showing $2.7 billion flowed into crypto assets last week, with the bulk of that going to Bitcoin. Both the token and a gauge of the largest 100 coins are up roughly 70% this year.

The success of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds launched in the US on Jan. 11 is a key driver of recent momentum. The ETFs from the likes of BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments have attracted a net inflow of about $10 billion so far. In the UK, the London Stock Exchange said it would accept applications for Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded notes, while Thailand’s securities regular signaled that it would open overseas crypto ETFs to retail buyers.

Institutional Demand

“We are seeing institutional adoption in the US,” Ophelia Snyder, 21Shares’ co-founder and president, said on Bloomberg Television. “It’s quite early still. Not all of the institutions, not all of the wire houses, have access to it.”

The structure of the Bitcoin market is changing as they enter the fray, for instance a greater focus on US trading hours, she added.

Some commentators are flagging the possibility of further gains. Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG Australia Pty, wrote in a note that Bitcoin “is expected to be well-supported on dips by those looking to position for a push toward $80,000 in the months ahead.” Fairlead Strategies LLC technical analyst Katie Stockton also suggested $80,000 is within reach in the medium term.

Futures Market

In the derivatives sector, outstanding contracts — or open interest — at Chicago-based CME Group’s Bitcoin futures market reached a fresh peak. The number breached 30,000 for the first time on Monday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The increase is a sign of greater US institutional demand for crypto-related exposure and hedging.

Bitcoin’s rally is creating roughly 1,500 new “millionaire wallets” daily, according to crypto analytics firm Kaiko Research, though the nature of blockchain data means it is difficult to determine which of those wallets are held by individuals and which by companies. That is still lower than the pace of millionaire wallets minted during the token’s 2021 bull run, however, when more than 4,000 wallets a day hit the million-dollar mark.

Next month, Bitcoin undergoes an event known as the halving, which as the name suggests cuts the supply of new Bitcoin in half. Demand from ETFs, constrained supply and expectations of looser monetary policy are all stoking a bullish mood in crypto — leading investors to put memories of the painful and deep 2022 bear market to one side.

,Crypto’s ‘Alameda Gap’ Narrows as Billions Pour Into Bitcoin ETFs,"(Bloomberg) -- A long awaited batch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds is already influencing the way crypto markets function, just two months after they launched in the US on Jan. 11.

    NY Says Trump Should Post Full Bond During Fraud Case Appeal

The spot Bitcoin ETFs brought to market by the likes of BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments have already drawn net inflows of about $10 billion, while helping to push the price of the token they track to record highs. Bitcoin topped $72,900 for the first time on Tuesday, before pulling back to around $70,000.

While the impact of the ETFs on price is clear, they are also responsible for subtler changes in the way Bitcoin is traded. Their advent is bringing crypto trading patterns more closely into line with those seen in traditional markets.

Trading volumes for the 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs launched on Jan. 11 began to pick up considerably in late February, in line with Bitcoin’s surge. On March 5 alone, $10.4 billion out of a total $61 billion in spot Bitcoin trading volumes went to ETF products.

ETFs are gradually improving liquidity for spot Bitcoin traders, after a slump known as the ‘Alameda gap’ triggered by the demise of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried’s failed exchange, and its sister firm Alameda Research.

Market depth — the crypto market’s ability to absorb relatively large orders without major price ructions — has improved since the Bitcoin ETFs launched.

“Bitcoin liquidity has improved notably over the past two months and is up roughly 60% since the approval of spot ETFs in early January. Both market makers and traders have returned to the market with BTC 2% depth now nearing its pre-FTX levels in US dollar terms,” Kaiko analyst Dessislava Aubert told Bloomberg over email.

The arrival of ETFs, and the institutional investors they’ve enticed, has also changed the hours an average crypto trader works. Crypto has traditionally been viewed as a 24/7 market, with assets traded day and night, throughout the week.

The chart above demonstrates a flurry of activity around the time traditional markets close, when the net-asset values of ETFs are fixed.

“Over 55% of Bitcoin trading against the US dollar now occurs during US hours, up from 47% last year, with nearly 90% taking place on weekdays,” Aubert said.

Before the spot ETFs were approved, ProShares Bitcoin Strategy and ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy — two Bitcoin futures-based ETFs — made up about 84% of the trading volume for US crypto-linked exchange traded products. That’s now down to 16% in March as the 10 spot ETFs, that offer a lower fee compared to the ProShares products, now amount close to 80% of the trading volumes.

,NFT Providers May Need Registration to Comply With UK Money Laundering Rules,"    NFT providers may need to be registered with the Financial Conduct Authority, the Treasury said in a consultation on money laundering regulations.

    NFTs are unlikely to be covered by the rules for financial services, which will have a separate authorization regime.

    The deadline for responses is June 9.

Crypto businesses that issue non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the U.K. rather than providing financial services will probably need to register with the Financial Conduct Authority even after the government introduces a new authorization regime for the industry, according to a consultation on money laundering issued by the Treasury on Monday.

The government has been refining its crypto regulation environment, and last year said it planned to bring crypto exchanges and custody providers into the new crypto authorization regime. Currently, the firms must be registered with the FCA, which covers money laundering and terrorism financing safeguards, to be able to operate in the country. Once the new regime is up and running, that won't be necessary.

However, crypto assets that are not used in relation to any regulated financial services, such as NFTs, are likely to fall outside the regime, according to the consultation. NFTs are unique tokens that are tied to the blockchain that usually represent an asset like art.

""These crypto asset firms will still need to be registered and supervised by the FCA for anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing purposes,"" the document said.

The Financial Services and Markets Act passed last year and paved the way for crypto to be treated like a regulated financial activity. In a consultation response from October, the government said NFT's ""were not appropriate for regulation as a financial service."" They would fall within the financial services regime only if used for regulated activities.

The number of firms that may need to get registered may ""widen as the industry continues to develop,"" the new consultation document said.

The U.K. government wants to collect responses on the proposed regime by June 9.

,Bitcoin Bulls Racing for $450K? Zooming in on Crypto ETFs,"Bitcoin surged above the $72,000 mark on Monday, driven by supply challenges, hopes of the Fed cutting interest rates in June and robust demand for the digital asset since introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs.
Optimistic Outlook

The digital asset reaching its fresh record peak is reflective of the bullish sentiment of investors, with many anticipating Bitcoin to rally further throughout 2024. According to Standard Chartered, as quoted on Yahoo Finance, the cryptocurrency is expected to breach the $100,000 mark by the end of the current year.

Research firm Fundstrat estimates Bitcoin to settle around $116,000-$137,000, while hedge fund SkyBridge foresees the asset hitting $170,000 by April 2025. VanEck maintained its medium-term estimate for the asset at $350,000.

Per Mark Connors, head of research for crypto asset manager 3iQ, the cryptocurrency is expected to hit $180,000 by the end of 2024, reaching $450,000 by 2025.
Supply Squeeze Spurs Rally

Currently limited to only 900 coins being generated daily by the Bitcoin network, the demand for Bitcoin significantly outpaces its supply. Since January, the newly introduced ETFs have been acquiring an average of 4,000 coins daily, according to Yahoo Finance.

Trading activity has surged due to the introduction of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, drawing in billions since their January debut.

However, the currency's supply is anticipated to face further constraints in April, wherein Bitcoin will experience a phenomenon referred to as the halving, which happens every four years. This will result in the supply of the digital asset being curbed by 50%, lending further support to its price.
Inflow Avalanche

Bitcoin continues its unprecedented surge, driven by record-breaking capital inflows into cryptocurrency products and the imminent reduction in the digital token's supply growth. According to Yahoo Finance, last week alone, a staggering $2.7 billion flooded into crypto assets, with the majority directed toward Bitcoin, as reported by CoinShares International Ltd.

ETFs offered by industry giants such as BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments have collectively attracted a net inflow of $9.5 billion to date.
Bitcoin Futures Reflect Bullish Sentiment

With the demand for the digital currency rising among institutional investors and the investment community, increased Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Futures' open interest, coupled with a rise in prices, confirms the upward trend in Bitcoin.

According to Coindesk, the CME Bitcoin futures market is experiencing unprecedented activity. Last Friday, a record-breaking 28,899 standard futures contracts were active on the CME, representing a notional open interest of $10.3 billion, double the peak reached during the 2021 bull market, which stood at $5.2 billion.
Rate Cut by Fed to Boost Prices

If the Fed cuts rates in June 2024, investors may view Bitcoin as an alternative to the depreciating dollar, which moves inversely with interest rate adjustments by the Fed. The rising probability of the Fed cutting interest rates from the second half of this year, coupled with de-dollarization, tends to create opportunities in digital currencies.

Moreover, any Fed rate cut would boost risk-on sentiments, which, in turn, would help Bitcoin prices.
ETFs in Focus

Below, we mention a few ETFs for investors to increase their portfolio’s exposure to Bitcoin and capitalize on its bullish trend.
Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) gained 45.83% over the last month and 161.51% over the last year.
IShares Bitcoin Trust Registered (IBIT) gained 44.84% over the last month.
ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) gained 45.33% over the last month and 146.41% over the last year.
Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) gained 45.18% over the last month.
ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) gained 44.84% over the last month.
Ethereum's Rally on the Horizon?

Following the remarkable demand witnessed for spot Bitcoin ETFs in the initial two months of their launch, market analysts are eagerly anticipating the approval of a spot Ethereum ETF, according to CoinGape.

However, enthusiasm for this prospect appears to be fading but investors can be on the lookout for the following funds to profit from the anticipated approval.
ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) gained 48.31% over the last month and 61.95% over the past three months.
VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) gained 38.36% over the last month and 48.65% over the past three months.
Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) gained 47.81% over the last month and 62.19% over the past three months.

Inflow Avalanche Bitcoin continues its unprecedented surge, driven by record-breaking capital inflows into cryptocurrency products and the imminent reduction in the digital token's supply growth. 7 billion flooded into crypto assets, with the majority directed toward Bitcoin, as reported by CoinShares International Ltd. Bitcoin Futures Reflect Bullish Sentiment With the demand for the digital currency rising among institutional investors and the investment community, increased Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Futures' open interest, coupled with a rise in prices, confirms the upward trend in Bitcoin. According to Coindesk, the CME Bitcoin futures market is experiencing unprecedented activity. The rising probability of the Fed cutting interest rates from the second half of this year, coupled with de-dollarization, tends to create opportunities in digital currencies. Moreover, any Fed rate cut would boost risk-on sentiments, which, in turn, would help Bitcoin prices.

,"AI, Bitcoin And Clean Energy Boom Are Straining U.S. Power Supply","The tech world is currently living through the Fourth Industrial Revolution as Artificial Intelligence (AI), cryptocurrencies and clean energy have emerged as some of the biggest secular megatrends of our time. AI and Machine Learning (""ML"") have become the biggest consumer tech buzzwords thanks in large part thanks to ChatGPT, OpenAI’s generative AI chatbot. ChatGPT has become AI’s poster child, managing to garner 100 million users 60 days after its November 2022 launch.

Energy companies are increasingly deploying AI tools to analyze vast troves of data and geological maps, digitize records and potentially identify problems such as pipeline corrosion and/or excessive equipment use. Last year, Dutch energy giant Shell Plc (NYSE:SHEL) announced plans to use AI-based technology from big-data analytics firm SparkCognition in its deep sea exploration and production in a bid to boost production and improve operational efficiency. Generative AI for seismic imaging can dramatically cut exploration timelines from nine months to less than nine days. Back in 2019, BP Plc (NYSE:BP) teamed up with AI start-up Belmont Technology and developed a cloud-based geoscience platform nicknamed “Sandy.” Sandy allows BP to interpret geophysics, geology and reservoir project information and also perform simulations using the program’s AI neural networks.

On the crypto scene, the bitcoin craze has gone into overdrive as the leading cryptocurrency keeps taking out new highs with FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) keeping markets bustling as more and more traders pile in to take advantage of the wild rally. Bitcoin price was up 4.2% on Monday’s intraday session to trade at $72,486,  a couple hundred bucks off its all-time high. The latest bitcoin surge has been chalked up to bitcoin’s upcoming halving event on April 20--bitcoin’s fourth halving event–during which mining rewards will be halved from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, effectively reducing the rate at which new bitcoin is introduced into circulation.

Meanwhile, many countries are doubling down on renewable energy after a brief hiatus during the Covid-19 pandemic. According to BloombergNEF, in 2023, clean energy investment globally increased by 17% to $1.8 trillion, with 1.7 dollars going into renewable energy for every dollar invested in fossil fuels.

Unfortunately, these exciting and seismic shifts in tech and financial circles are coming at a huge cost: high energy consumption. According to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), the AI boom, cryptocurrency mining and increased clean technology manufacturing are straining U.S. energy supplies leading to energy sources struggling to keep pace. NERC's most recent long-term reliability assessment has projected that power demand in the summer of 2024 will hit its highest level since 2016 while winter demand will hit its highest level since at least 2015.

""The [Bulk Power System] is currently forecast to have its highest demand and energy growth rates since 2014, mainly driven by electrification and projections for growth in electric vehicles over this assessment period,"" NERC wrote.

Power Hungry Technologies

According to NERC, resource growth is ""becoming more challenging"" as more and more fossil fuel generation sources are retired adding that ""[m]ore than 83GW of generator retirements are planned through 2033, and more are expected. Generation plans need to consider growing energy needs and grid stability.""

""Across the board, we are seeing power companies say, 'We don't know if we can handle this; we have to audit our system; we've never dealt with this kind of influx before, "" Andy Cvengros, the managing director of data center markets at commercial real estate firm JLL, has told The Washington Post.

Industry insiders have started acknowledging that these technologies powering the fourth industrial revolution are indeed power hungry. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has declared that the world needs an energy breakthrough like fusion if AI is to achieve its full potential.

""There's no way to get there without a breakthrough. It motivates us to go invest more in fusion,"" Altman has said. Altman has invested $375 million in private nuclear fusion company Helion Energy.

Even more alarming is the likelihood of AI power demand skyrocketing from here.

According to Sreedhar Sistu, vice president of artificial intelligence for Schneider Electric, excluding China, AI represents 4.3 GW of global power demand, and could grow almost five-fold by 2028. AI tasks  typically demand more powerful hardware than traditional computing tasks.

AI-servers are power-hungry devices: Digiconomist estimates that a single NVIDIA DGX A100 server consumes as much electricity as several U.S. households combined. This implies that powering a couple of millions of these devices could easily strain the power grids they are supposed to make more efficient.

Meanwhile, bitcoin mining shows no signs of slowing down, hitting 565 exahashes per second (EH/s) currently, a five-fold increase from three years ago. Digiconmist estimates that bitcoin mining consumes 148.63 TWh of electricity per year, comparable to the power consumption of Malaysia, and emits 82.90 Mt CO2 per year, similar to the carbon footprint of Bangladesh. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that bitcoin mining accounts for up to 2.3% of U.S. electricity consumption. Galaxy Digital analysts had earlier estimated that between 15% and 20% of the hash rate coming from eight ASIC models could go offline when the halving occurs, because the economics would no longer make sense. However, it had used BTC price of $45,000 in its assumptions, much lower than the current BTC price approaching $75,000. In other words, few, if any, bitcoin miners will be put out of business after the April 20 halving event thanks to the wild bitcoin rally.

Last year, the White House proposed a plan to have crypto miners pay extra for the energy they consume. Dubbed the Digital Asset Mining Energy (DAME) tax, miners would pay a tax equal to 30% of the electricity they use in crypto mining.

,The US Government says IP infringement is all over NFT marketplaces,"The non-fungible token (NFT) bubble burst quite some time ago, but the US Government has only just published a report looking into the surrounding legal framework. The study, carried out jointly by the US Copyright Office (USCO) and the Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) following a 2022 request by the Senate, determined that current intellectual property laws are robust enough to deal with copyright or trademark infringement in NFTs. The agencies also determined that although there are some benefits to the tokens, ""trademark infringement and misuse is prevalent on NFT marketplaces.""

As a reminder, an NFT is a digital certificate of authenticity conferring ownership of a collectible, such as an artwork or piece of music. It's effectively a verified link to a piece of media which may or may not live on the blockchain, but whoever owns the destination of an NFT's URL can change the media it points to at any time. In one notable case in 2021, Signal founder Moxie Marlinspike created an NFT that he promised would appear to be a poop emoji when someone bought it.

The offices noted that NFTs and associated smart contracts can aid trademark owners in managing, licensing and transferring IP rights. Those who weighed in on the issue in public comments pointed out that NFTs can help artists make money from future sales of their work too. That's not inherently a bad thing, even if a large swath of NFT art is butt-ugly.

However, the study noted ""widespread concern that NFT buyers and sellers do not know what IP rights are implicated in the creation, marketing and transfer of NFTs and that NFTs may be used to facilitate copyright or trademark infringement.""

The report notes that the decentralized nature of NFTs and blockchain networks complicates any attempts to enforce trademarks. ""While some individual NFT platforms have developed protocols to help trademark owners enforce their rights, there is no centralized authority that requires all platforms to do so,"" the report reads. ""There are also no cross-platform mechanisms to allow trademark owners to identify and take down infringing content, settle trademark-related disputes involving blockchain-based domain names, or confirm that sellers own the trademark rights associated with the assets they offer.""

With all of that in mind, the offices said that educating the public about NFTs could help ensure a better understanding and awareness of the tokens and how they work. Still, they recommended in their report to Congress that the current use of NFTs doesn't require changes to current IP laws. They also noted that ""incorporating NFTs into their registration and recordation practices is not necessary or advisable at this time.""

,MicroStrategy ‘Not Resting on Its Laurels’ as Bitcoin Hits All-Time High: Canaccord,"    MicroStrategy continues to add to its bitcoin stash despite the digital asset's price hitting all-time high.

    Canaccord raised its price target on the stock to a street high of $1,810.

    Despite driving shareholder value via its bitcoin acquisition strategy, no other direct competitors have emerged.

MicroStrategy (MSTR) is not “resting on its laurels” despite bitcoin {{BTC}} trading at an all-time high, as the software company and largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency continues to add to its stash, investment bank Canaccord Genuity said in a research report Monday.

Canaccord almost doubled its MicroStrategy price target to $1,810 from $975, the highest among Wall Street analysts, according to FactSet data. The investment bank maintained its buy rating on the stock.

Following the company’s oversubscribed and upsized $800 million convertible debt offering last week, MicroStrategy said that it had bought approximately 12,000 additional bitcoin at an average price of about $68.5K, using cash and proceeds from the offering, the report said.

“Purchasing this additional bitcoin via a convert has helped drive MSTR’s equity value premium relative to its BTC HODL to approximately 86% according to our sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) analysis,” analysts led by Joseph Vafi wrote.

Recent bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuances have only driven this premium higher, and a couple of months after approval, the MSTR premium has reached new highs, Canaccord said.

“This re-expansion has been a bit of a pleasant surprise to us despite more competition from ETFs,” the authors wrote, adding that the premium does make some sense as MicroStrategy’s bitcoin acquisition strategy of “only buying BTC when its stock trades at a relative premium to its HODL,” has been accretive.

Despite MSTR’s strong track record of driving shareholder value via its bitcoin acquisition strategy, the report added that no other corporates have emerged as competitors for investor dollars, meaning it has no direct competition.

,VanEck Spot Bitcoin ETF Sees Record $119M Inflow After Fee Cut to 0%,"Asset manager VanEck's spot bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded fund (ETF) saw record daily inflows on Monday after cutting management fees to 0% for a year to make it more attractive.

The VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL) attracted $119 million in fresh funds during the day, adding over 1,600 bitcoin, the most by a wide margin since its launch in January, data compiled by BitMEX Research shows.

VanEck lowered the management fee from 0.2% until March 31, 2025, unless it reaches $1.5 billion in assets under management, making it more attractive in a fierce competition between the newly listed bitcoin ETFs.

With Monday's inflows, VanEck's offering became the sixth-largest U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETF, handling more than 6,000 BTC ($440 million) in assets under management and overtaking rivals Invesco (BTCO) and Valkyrie (BRRR), according to BitMEX data.

Spot bitcoin ETFs have enjoyed a streak of strong inflows as the bitcoin price rallied past $72,000 to record highs. Monday brought almost $1 billion of inflows for the nine new offerings combined, more than compensating for $500 million of outflows from the incumbent Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), BitMEX data show.

,Jamie Dimon Defends Right to Buy Bitcoin Even Though He Never Will,"    JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon compared buying bitcoin to smoking a cigarette.

    He repeated his criticism of cryptocurrency being used for illegal activity.

    Dimon also encouraged the Fed to wait until June before cutting interest rates.

Jamie Dimon, CEO of U.S. banking giant JPMorgan (JPM), said he will ""defend your right to buy bitcoin,"" even if he personally will never buy any himself.

""I defend your right to smoke a cigarette, [and] I’ll defend your right to buy a Bitcoin,” he said, according to a Reuters report, citing a video appearance at the Australian Financial Review business summit. “I will personally never buy Bitcoin and I do think it’s a risk if you are a buyer. When governments look at all this stuff, why do they put up with it?”

Dimon also repeated his criticism that a lot of the practical uses for cryptocurrency were illegal activity like fraud and terrorism.

Dimon has been a consistent critic of the cryptocurrency over the years, but these latest comments suggest just the tiniest bit of softening. After all, it was in December that he told a U.S. Senate committee he would shut Bitcoin down were he the government.

Holding court at Davos one month later, he compared BTC to a ""pet rock.""

On the broader matter of the U.S. economy, Dimon urged the Federal Reserve to wait until June before cutting interest rates as a means of ensuring it is winning its fight against inflation.

""If I were them, I would wait,"" he said. ""You can always cut it quickly and dramatically. Their credibility is a little bit at stake here. I would even wait past June and let it all sort it out.""

Earlier this morning, the government's inflation report for February showed an unexpected rise.

    He repeated his criticism of cryptocurrency being used for illegal activity.

    Dimon also encouraged the Fed to wait until June before cutting interest rates.

Jamie Dimon, CEO of U.S. banking giant JPMorgan (JPM), said he will ""defend your right to buy bitcoin,"" even if he personally will never buy any himself.

""I defend your right to smoke a cigarette, [and] I’ll defend your right to buy a Bitcoin,” he said, according to a Reuters report, citing a video appearance at the Australian Financial Review business summit. “I will personally never buy Bitcoin and I do think it’s a risk if you are a buyer. When governments look at all this stuff, why do they put up with it?”

Dimon also repeated his criticism that a lot of the practical uses for cryptocurrency were illegal activity like fraud and terrorism.

Dimon has been a consistent critic of the cryptocurrency over the years, but these latest comments suggest just the tiniest bit of softening. After all, it was in December that he told a U.S. Senate committee he would shut Bitcoin down were he the government.

,"EU Tightens Grip on Sanctions Violators, Includes Crypto in New Laws","The European Parliament has approved a set of rules aimed at cracking down on violations of EU sanctions, introducing stringent criminal penalties and harmonizing enforcement across the 27 member states.

The new legislation, passed with 543 votes in favor, 45 against, and 27 abstentions, comes amid growing concerns over divergent national approaches that have allowed loopholes to persist in the implementation of EU sanctions regimes.

At the heart of the directive lies a unified definition of what constitutes a sanctions violation, encompassing acts such as failing to freeze funds, disregarding travel bans or arms embargoes, transferring funds to sanctioned individuals or entities, and conducting business with state-owned enterprises of countries under sanctions.

Notably, the rules specifically apply to crypto service providers, making it a violation to provide prohibited crypto-related services like crypto wallets or asset freezing to sanctioned entities.

Perhaps most notably, the rules criminalize the circumvention of sanctions, making it a punishable offense to conceal or transfer funds that should be frozen, obscure true ownership of property, or fail to report necessary information related to sanctions compliance.

Under the new directive, member states will be required to introduce minimum penalties for sanctions violations, including prison sentences of up to five years. Companies found guilty of such transgressions could face substantial fines, with judges empowered to levy penalties based on either the worldwide annual turnover of the offending entity or predetermined maximum amounts.","The European Parliament has approved a set of rules aimed at cracking down on violations of EU sanctions, introducing stringent criminal penalties and harmonizing enforcement across the 27 member states.

,Rapper Drake Posts Michael Saylor's Bitcoin Video to His 146M Instagram Followers,"    Grammy-award-winning musician Drake posted a clip of Michael Saylor speaking about Bitcoin on his Instagram account on Tuesday.

    The rapper was previously active in the digital assets space when he placed bets for the 2022 Super Bowl through Bitcoin and as an ambassador for crypto Grambling site Stake.

Canadian rapper Drake on Tuesday shared a clip of Michael Saylor’s interview on CNBC on his Instagram account, reaching over 146 million followers.

Drake, who goes under the username “champagnepapi” on the social media app, reshared a clip from bitcoin_memes_daily, which captioned the video “Michael Saylor on Bitcoin.”

Saylor on Monday told CNBC that Bitcoin would “eat” gold as it is the superior asset. In the clip posted by Drake, he specifically spoke about Bitcoin’s use case as a store of value rather than a medium of exchange.

Celebrities endorsing crypto has been a trend during the last bull market, including Larry David's now famous FTX Super Bowl ad - which he later regretted. This time around, however, there haven’t been too many celebrities and influencers who have been shilling crypto to the masses. Drake's post likely would mark one of the first large-scale endorsements of any kind during this bull market and may pique retail investors' interest back into the digital assets market.
